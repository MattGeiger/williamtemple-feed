/**
 * What a sanitized backup contains, and — just as importantly — what it does
 * not.
 *
 * `docs/data-management/backup-and-restore.md` is the approved boundary: a raw
 * SQLite snapshot necessarily carries key material, authentication records, and
 * encrypted provider secrets, so it stays an operator concern and is never a
 * browser download. The in-app artifact is a *selective logical export*, and
 * "selective" is only meaningful if the selection is enumerated rather than
 * implied.
 *
 * Every model in the schema appears in exactly one of INCLUDED_TABLES or
 * EXCLUDED_TABLES. A test reads the Prisma schema and fails if any model is
 * missing from both, so a table added later cannot drift into a backup — or
 * silently out of one — without somebody making that call deliberately.
 *
 * REDACTED_COLUMNS is the third category: tables that are exported with
 * specific columns stripped, for the case where excluding the whole table to
 * protect one field would also discard an administrator's work.

/**
 * Excluded tables that hold foreign keys INTO included tables, and must be

 *
 * Restore copies the live database, then deletes and reloads the selected
 * units — so an excluded table survives the copy still pointing at rows the
 * restore is about to delete. `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON` is set on the scratch
 * database, so the delete fails with P2003 and the whole restore aborts.
 *
 * This was not theoretical: eight `UsageRecord` rows were enough to break a
 * full restore, and the generic error handler rendered the constraint failure
 * as "Cannot delete this item because it is referenced by other items" — a
 * message about deleting one item, shown for a failed disaster-recovery
 * restore. Any instance with AI usage telemetry would have hit it, including
 * production, at exactly the moment recovery mattered. See ISSUES.md #73.
 *
 * Clearing rather than preserving is the right call for both entries below,
 * and only because of what they are. `UsageRecord` is aggregated telemetry the
 * contract already describes as "rebuilt from operation rather than restored".
 * `ShoppingListInstance` is generated output bound to a `ShoppingListPDF` file
 * the artifact does not carry, so its rows are already dangling after a
 * restore. Neither is organization data a user authored.
 *
 * A table must NOT be added here to make a restore pass if its rows are
 * something a user would miss. That case needs a different answer — carrying
 * the table in the artifact, or nulling the reference — not silent deletion.
