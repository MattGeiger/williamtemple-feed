    /**
     * **Superseded 2026-08-18 — read this first.** The file reviewed on the
     * 17th was labelled "ALL-TIME" and was not: a real 2017-01-01..2026-05-31
     * export holds 16,728 rows and matches **every one** of the 9,596 Link2Feed
     * clients FEED stores, against 4,324 for the file below. The recency bias,
     * the id floor, and the "covers less, not more" verdict were all artefacts
     * of that one export, not properties of this dataset.
     *
     * 7,132 of its rows are clients FEED has no visit for. Note what this is
     * *not*: the export's 2017-01-01 start is simply the earliest date
     * Link2Feed offers, and William Temple House did not adopt Link2Feed until
     * October 2020 — FEED's visits begin 2020-10-19, so both records start at
     * adoption and the file does not reach further back. Registration without a
     * recorded visit is the likelier reading, but it is unconfirmed; establish
     * which before quoting the figure or treating it as an import gap.
     *
     * So the two fields that are genuinely unique to this path —
     * `Client Ethnicity-Parent Types` (the rollup that makes an ethnicity card
     * legible; the labels alone run to 86 combinations) and `Household ID` —
     * are now available at full coverage rather than 45%. The case for
     * activating this path is materially stronger than the note below concluded.
     * Re-measure with `scripts/measure-l2f-client-coverage.ts` before acting,
     * and confirm the export's span against FEED's visit span.
     *
     * ---
     *
     * Reviewed 2026-08-17 against a sanitized "all-time" client export, and not
     * activated. Retained because its column-level findings still hold; its
     * coverage findings do not.
     *
     * **The visits import already collected this.** Every demographic dimension
     * in the client export is stored for all 9,596 Link2Feed clients — gender
     * identity and its parent types, ethnicity, disability, self-identifies-as,
     * city/county/state/postal code, housing type, languages, primary income
     * source, dietary considerations, social assistance — plus every birth year.
     *
     * **The export covers less, not more.** 6,460 rows against 9,596 clients
     * FEED holds; 4,324 in both. 3,344 of our clients carry ids below the file's
     * lowest (5,466,020) and cannot appear in it at all, and above that floor
     * coverage climbs 64% → 88% from oldest ids to newest. The clients it omits
     * have *better* demographic coverage in FEED (55–95% per dimension) than the
     * ones it includes (26–66%), because a long-standing client has more visits
     * and each visit was another chance to record a profile.
     *
     * **Most of its extra columns are empty.** The 23 per-income-source flags
     * are `0` on every one of the 6,460 rows. Monthly Household Income carries a
     * real figure on 15 rows. Names, emails, phones and street are PII this
     * importer would drop anyway, which is why they are absent from the
     * allowlist above.
     *
     * **Two fields are genuinely only here.** `Client Ethnicity-Parent Types` —
     * the rollup that would make an ethnicity card legible, since the labels
     * alone run to 86 combinations, and it is absent from the visits export.
     * And `Household ID`, which groups clients into 5,328 households. Household
     * ID confirms rather than corrects: only 47 of 4,277 households have more
     * than one visiting client id, and 5 household-days out of 26,827 visits
     * were served under two, so Link2Feed records visits against the head of
     * household and the existing household counts are sound.
     *
     * Link2Feed is proprietary and the visits export cannot be extended, so the
     * ethnicity rollup is obtainable only through this path. Revisit if a
     * legible ethnicity breakdown becomes worth a second import path — and
     * expect the recency bias above to need stating on any card drawn from it.
     *
     * The real vocabulary is 51 columns against the 20 provisionally listed
     * here; `Client First Visit- Personal Tab` and `Client First Visit-Date` are
     * absent from the sample. Dates arrive as Excel serials when the file has
     * been opened in Excel, as with the visits export.
