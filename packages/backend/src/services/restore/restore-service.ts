/**
 * Restore by **building a new database and swapping it in**, never by mutating
 * the live one.
 *
 * A single interactive transaction cannot do this: the largest procurement
 * import already lands near 18s against the 30s ceiling in `db.ts`, and a full
 * restore is an order of magnitude larger. Raising the ceiling would mean
 * holding a multi-minute write lock and, if it failed at minute four, having
 * blocked the pantry for nothing.
 *
 * ## How the new file is built
 *
 * The design called for `migrate deploy` against an empty file. This uses
 * `VACUUM INTO` to take a consistent copy of the live database instead, which
 * reaches the same place with fewer moving parts:
 *
 * - the schema is necessarily current, because it *is* the live schema — no
 *   dependency on the Prisma CLI being present and no second migration run;
 * - everything a partial restore is not replacing is already there, correct,
 *   and consistent, rather than needing a carry-across pass per table;
 * - `VACUUM INTO` is WAL-safe by construction: it writes a clean database with
 *   no sidecar journals, so there is no window where the copy disagrees with
 *   the source.
 *
 * Only the selected units are then cleared and repopulated from the artifact.
 *
 * ## Why the live file is safe
 *
 * Nothing touches `production.db` until a single `rename(2)`, which is atomic
 * on the same filesystem — and the scratch file is deliberately placed beside
 * it on the same bind mount so that guarantee holds. Rollback is renaming the
 * pre-swap snapshot back.

/**
 * Exit code used to hand the process back to its supervisor for a restart.
 *
 * 75 is EX_TEMPFAIL — "temporary failure, the user is invited to retry" — which
 * is as close as the sysexits list gets to "going away on purpose, expecting to
 * come back". Docker restarts on any code, so this is for the logs, not for the
 * supervisor.
 *
 * **It does not make `npm run dev` recover.** `ts-node-dev --respawn` means
 * "keep watching for changes after the script exits", not "restart when it
 * exits" — it waits for a file to change. Measured, after a false start: the
 * dev backend stayed down following a reset at exit 0, appeared to be fixed by
 * a non-zero code, and then stayed down again at 75 when no file had been
 * edited. The earlier recovery was the file edit tripping the watcher, not the
 * exit code.
