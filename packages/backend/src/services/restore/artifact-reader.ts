/**
 * Validate an uploaded artifact **before** anything touches disk.
 *
 * Everything here is pure: parse, check, report. The restore contract requires
 * validating "artifact type, manifest, checksums, FEED/schema version, and
 * table contract before touching live data", and keeping that as a function of
 * a string makes it cheap to test exhaustively and impossible to half-apply.
 *
 * ## Version contract
 *
 * `tableContractVersion` is the gate; `schemaVersion` is provenance. Most
 * migrations do not touch exported tables, so refusing on a migration-name
 * mismatch would reject valid artifacts and teach people to bypass the check.
 * A newer contract than this build understands is refused, naming the problem.
 * An older one is adapted by a reader for that version.

 * where somebody looking for them would think to look.
 *
 * v1 → v2: v1 excluded `AIConfiguration` wholesale. There is nothing to
 * back-fill; the table is simply absent, and a restore from a v1 file leaves AI
 * configuration untouched rather than clearing it.
 *
 * v2 → v3: v2 predates Service tables. Missing Service sections likewise mean
 * that Service is unavailable as a restore unit; existing Service data is not
 * cleared by selecting another unit from the older artifact.
 *
 * v3 → v4: v3 contains the first Service fact family but predates capacity
 * plans and persistent quality evidence. Those absent sections stay absent;
 * no policy or operator decision is inferred during restore.
 *
 * v4 → v5: v4 Service encounters predate `clientVisitStatus`. Prisma applies
 * the schema default `unknown` when those rows are restored; a reader must not
 * infer first/returning status from any other field.
 *
 * v5 → v6: v5 predates SIMC person identities, person profiles, and encounter
 * membership. Those sections remain unavailable in older artifacts; FEED does
 * not derive people from household counts during restore.
 *
 * v6 → v7: v6 operational observations predate optional source metric labels
 * and workbook-cell provenance. Prisma leaves those nullable fields empty for
 * older artifacts; FEED never invents workbook provenance during restore.
 *
 * v7 → v8: v7 operational observations predate intentional clear revisions.
 * Prisma applies the schema default `recorded` to restored older rows; FEED
 * does not reinterpret any historical value as a clear.
 *
 * v8 → v9: v8 Service metric revisions predate user-selected icons. Prisma
 * applies the neutral `package` default; FEED does not infer semantics while
 * restoring an older organization-data artifact.
 *
 * v10 → v11: v10 predates the authority-neutralized staff roster and LOTTO
 * synchronization-run provenance. Their absence leaves those restore units
 * unavailable; no account or run is manufactured from older artifacts.
 *
 * v11 → v12: v11 predates organization branding and database-backed brand
 * assets. Their absent sections are preserved in the destination rather than
 * being interpreted as an instruction to remove the destination identity.
