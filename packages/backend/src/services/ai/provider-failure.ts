 * been collapsing every provider failure into "Invalid API key
 * configuration", so a model an account cannot call was reported as a bad key
 * and the provider's real answer reached only the server log (ISSUES.md #84).
 * `builder-translation.ts` re-exports it, so its callers and tests are

 *
 * The order of the tests is load-bearing:
 *
 * 1. "No provider at all" first, because that error carries no status and no
 *    provider vocabulary, and would otherwise fall through every test below
 *    to `unavailable` -- telling a freshly restored instance that the service
 *    "didn't respond" when nothing was ever asked.
 * 2. Quota next. An exhausted account reports the same 429 as genuine rate
 *    limiting, and a billing-limit refusal can arrive as a 403 -- so money
 *    wording wins over both the status and the overload markers.
 * 3. Configuration by status or wording. A 401/403/404 is a refusal
 *    on the merits; no amount of waiting changes it.
 * 4. Overload last, so a bare `429` in the payload only means `busy` once the
 *    account-level and configuration readings have been ruled out.
