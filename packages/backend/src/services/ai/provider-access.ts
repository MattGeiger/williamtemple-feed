/**
 * One way in for every translation surface: get the active AI service, or
 * fail with a sentence that says what actually went wrong.
 *
 * Before this, each route called `validateApiKey()` — a boolean — and
 * answered `400 Invalid API key configuration` for every possible failure.
 * A working key calling a model the account cannot use (Google now refuses
 * `gemini-2.5-*` to new projects; OpenAI refuses models outside a project's
 * allow-list) was therefore reported as a bad key, and the provider's real
 * answer reached only the server log. That is ISSUES.md #84, and it is why
 * the reported fault looked like a key problem for days.
 *
 * This helper keeps the provider's error, classifies it, names the model,
 * alerts an administrator when only they can clear it, and throws a route
 * error carrying a machine-readable code.
