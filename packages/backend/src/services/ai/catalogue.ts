/**
 * What FEED knows about each AI model, in one place.
 *
 * This replaces `model-specs.ts`, which held prices and limits in two
 * byte-identical copies with nothing enforcing that they agree (ISSUES.md
 * #84). Both copies are deleted now: the providers read this module directly,
 * the configuration dialogs read it over `GET /api/ai-config/models`, and a
 * test fails if a second list reappears. It carries the same facts, plus the
 * two kinds of knowledge the duplicated file could not express.
 *
 * **Lifecycle**, because a model's availability changes under us. A provider
 * withdraws a model, or stops offering it to new accounts, and FEED finds out
 * when a translation fails. Recording a shutdown date and a replacement lets
 * the interface say so first.
 *
 * **Capabilities**, because what a model accepts is not derivable from its
 * name. Every one of these was measured against a live API on 2026-09-11
 * rather than read off a documentation page, and three of them contradicted
 * what the docs implied:
 *
 *   - `claude-sonnet-5` refuses `temperature` outright — its presence, not
 *     its value, so sending the default does not help.
 *   - `claude-sonnet-5` refuses an assistant-message prefill.
 *   - `gpt-5.6-luna` refuses `reasoning_effort: 'minimal'`, which is FEED's
 *     spec default for `gpt-5-nano`, and refuses `max_tokens` in favour of
 *     `max_completion_tokens`.
 *
 * String tests on model ids cannot carry that. `model.includes('-4-5-')` was
 * the previous answer and it silently excluded every dateless Claude 5 id.
 *
 * The providers and the dialogs both read this now. What is left is the
 * catalogue's *contents*: the 2026 refresh that retires the models the
 * vendors have withdrawn and adds their replacements.

 * A storage vocabulary, not a per-model allowlist — no model takes all seven,
 * and one value is not known to be accepted by anything FEED can reach.
 * Measured against the live APIs on 2026-09-11:
 *
 *   gpt-5.6-luna / -terra / -sol   none, low, medium, high, xhigh
 *   gpt-6-astra                    low, medium, high, xhigh   (no `none`)
 *   gpt-5-*-2025-08-07             minimal, low, medium, high
 *
 * So `minimal` is valid on the 2025 snapshots and refused by GPT-5.6, while
 * `none` is GPT-5.6's floor and exists nowhere else.
 *
 * `max` is refused by every OpenAI model probed — `400 ... does not support
 * 'max' with this model` — and accepted by Anthropic: `claude-sonnet-5` with
 * `output_config: { effort: 'max' }` answered normally, as it did at `low`.
 * The value is real, and it is Anthropic's alone. Note the two providers
 * spell the same idea differently: OpenAI takes `reasoning_effort` on the
 * request, Anthropic takes `output_config.effort`, which is why this is a
 * shared vocabulary rather than one provider's parameter.
 *
 * The order is the cost order, so an index comparison decides what counts as
 * "above medium" for the D2 warning. What a *given* model accepts is per-entry
 * data — ask `capabilityAccepts`, never this list.

  // ---------------- Anthropic ----------------
  //
  // The Claude 5 generation, measured against the API on 2026-09-12. Three
  // things separate it from Haiku 4.5 above, and each one is a 400 if got
  // wrong:
  //
  //   - Sampling. `temperature`, `top_p` and `top_k` return 400 at any
  //     non-default value from Claude Opus 4.7 on, so nothing is sent.
  //   - Prefill. An assistant message seeding `{` returns 400 from Sonnet 4.6
  //     on, so the JSON comes from the prompt instead (D28).
  //   - Thinking. Adaptive and **on by default at effort `high`**, where
  //     everything above is manual `extended` thinking that is off unless
  //     asked. `AnthropicTranslationService.resolveThinking` is what keeps
  //     that from quietly billing `high` on every request.
  //
  // Retirement dates are Anthropic's *tentative* "not sooner than" floors, so
  // they live in `note` — a `shutdownDate` here would claim an announcement
  // that has not been made, and the invariant forbids one on an active entry.

  // ---------------- Google ----------------
  //
  // The 2026 refresh. Ids and token limits come from Google's own
  // `models.list`, prices from its pricing page by exact id, and the thinking
  // ranges from live probes on 2026-09-12 — the free metadata reports only
  // `thinking: true`, a boolean, so it can say *whether* a model thinks but
  // never at which levels.
  //
  //   gemini-3.5-flash-lite  minimal(0) medium(12) high(13)   all OK
  //   gemini-3.6-flash       minimal(0) medium(12) high(12)   all OK
  //   gemini-3.8-flash       minimal -> 400 "Thinking level MINIMAL is not
  //                          supported for this model";  low OK (11 thinking)
  //   gemini-3.1-pro-preview minimal -> 400, same;           low OK (11)
  //
  // The bracketed number is thinking tokens spent, and it is the whole D27
  // argument: 3.6 and 3.8 are the same list price, but 3.6 can run at
  // `minimal` for no thinking tokens at all while 3.8 cannot go below `low`
  // and bills 11 on every request, however trivial. For one-sentence
  // translations that is the entire reasoning budget, paid forever.
  //
  // Those bracketed figures hold for Flash and do NOT hold for Pro. Real
  // translations on 2026-09-13 — one three-word string through FEED's own
  // FOOD_TRANSLATION prompt, thinking level `low` sent to both:
  //
  //   gemini-3.8-flash         12 completion tokens   $0.00015
  //   gemini-3.1-pro-preview  262 completion tokens   $0.0034
  //
  // Same level, same prompt, ~22x the output and ~40x the cost of
  // 3.5-flash-lite. So `low OK (11)` is right for 3.8 and wrong for Pro by
  // more than an order of magnitude. Unconfirmed cause: `verifyEntitlement`
  // sends `maxOutputTokens: 64`, which cannot observe 262 — if these probes
  // ran through that path then every figure above is capped, and understates
  // any model that thinks heavily. Treat the table as a floor rather than a
  // measurement until it is re-taken through a real request.
  //
  // Google now says `temperature`, `topP` and `topK` are "no longer
  // recommended" on any 3.x model — advice, not refusal, so `sampling` stays
  // `supported` while `fixedTemperature` pins the value metadata reports
  // (`temperature: 1`, `maxTemperature: 2`). `rateLimits` is omitted: nothing
  // publishes per-model allowances for these, and inventing them would
  // pre-fill a configuration's usage limits with fiction.
