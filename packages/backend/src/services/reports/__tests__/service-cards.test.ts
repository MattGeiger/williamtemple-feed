/**
 * The Service lens, as reports.
 *
 * The lens shipped on screen with no registry entries at all, so selecting a
 * Service card produced an archive that silently omitted it — and a
 * Service-only selection crashed outright, because the printed header read a
 * `range` field only the other two lenses carry.
 *
 * These assert the decisions rather than the plumbing: that absence and zero
 * stay distinct across two archives beginning years apart, that an unfinished
 * month is dropped and named exactly as the screen drops and names it, and
 * that provenance survives a report drawn from Service alone.
