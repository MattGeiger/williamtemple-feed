 * `Purch-Don`, and Fresh Alliance missing the legacy history the screen stacks
 * onto it, understating that channel by 62%. Neither was visible without
 * comparing outputs side by side. Hence one accessor.
 *
 * **Filters are part of the data.** A card's title and series set can depend on

 * returned rather than taking it separately. The screen and the report are then
 * looking at the same source of truth and cannot disagree about what was asked
