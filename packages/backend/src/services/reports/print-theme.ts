 * its contrast exactly — a brand heading that cleared 7:1 in colour clears 7:1
 * in grey — and reads as a deliberate black-and-white rendering rather than an
 * accident of the printer.
 *
 * The series ramp is replaced rather than converted, because converting is what
 * fails: Carbon's grades are isoluminant, so luminance conversion maps every
 * one of them to the same grey. `PRINT_GREYSCALE_SERIES` varies lightness
 * instead, which is the only channel left once hue is gone.
