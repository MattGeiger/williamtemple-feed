/**
 * Readability-driven grain selection for time-series cards.
 *
 * A long range must stay exportable without the user thinking about it, so the
 * grain is derived from a physical constraint rather than a hard-coded rule: a
 * bar needs about 1.6mm on paper to read as a bar. Below that, the chart is a
 * grey smear that implies precision it cannot show.
 *
 * The threshold is stated in millimetres, not pixels, because the output is
 * vector — the SVG's user units map to a fixed printed width, so millimetres
 * are the units the rule is actually about and the only ones you can check
 * against a printed page.
 *
 * Condensing happens *here*, before both the chart and the CSV, not inside the
 * renderer. If the renderer condensed, the chart would show quarters while the
 * CSV still held months and the two files in one ZIP would disagree.
