/**
 * Brand-aligning the chart palette without touching its accessibility.
 *
 * FEED's categorical series come from IBM Carbon: ten families, every grade
 * already verified at 4.5:1 against the card surface. Generating colours
 * alongside that would undermine it, so brand alignment only changes *which*
 * accessible colour appears first.
 *
 * **Rotate, do not re-sort.** `CARBON_CATEGORICAL_ORDER` in the frontend is a
 * deliberate hue-hopping sequence — each family sits far from its neighbours on
 * the colour wheel so adjacent series stay distinguishable, including under
 * colour-vision deficiency. Re-sorting by distance to the brand hue clusters
 * similar hues together and destroys exactly that property. Rotating the list
 * so the brand-nearest family leads preserves every adjacent pair except the one
 * at the wrap point, so the guarantee survives by construction rather than by a
 * separately-enforced separation floor.

/**
 * The series ramp for a black-and-white report.
 *
 * Carbon's categorical grades sit at roughly equal luminance so that no series
 * dominates another, which is right on screen and is what makes the palette
 * colour-vision safe. On paper it means the series are separated by hue alone:
 * measured on a real export, all four rendered series mapped to greyscale
 * 111/255 — a spread of zero — so a mono printer or a photocopy turns every bar
 * the same grey and the legend becomes the only way to read the chart.
 *
 * Lightness is the only channel left once hue is gone, so this varies it. The
 * usual objection — that lightness reads as rank, implying a hierarchy the
 * series do not have — is why the colour palette must NOT do this, and why it
 * is fine here: the reader of a greyscale rendering knows hue has been removed.
 *
 * Spaced evenly in perceptual lightness between L 0.20 and L 0.66. Every step
 * clears 3:1 against white (WCAG 1.4.11 for meaningful graphics), the lightest
 * at 3.11:1, and adjacent steps differ by 1.23–1.39x in contrast, which is a
 * visible difference in grey.
 */

 * The ladder itself: seven greys spaced evenly in perceptual lightness between
 * L 0.20 and L 0.66. The lightest clears 3:1 against white, which WCAG 1.4.11

/**
 * Presentation order: ends first, then the middle, then the gaps.
 *
 * Charts take `palette[seriesIndex]`, so the order decides what a two-series
 * chart gets — and shipping the ladder in ascending order gave it the two
 * darkest neighbours. A stacked bar of "answered" against "not answered" came
 * out as two near-identical blacks, separated by a contrast ratio of 1.23.
 *
 * Bisecting instead means the first two series are the ends of the ladder and
 * every later one lands in the largest remaining gap, so separation degrades
 * gracefully as series are added rather than starting at its worst:
 *
 *   2 series  5.82x   3 series  2.24x   4 series  1.36x   5+  1.23x
 *
 * Most report charts carry two or three series, which is where the difference
 * between 5.82 and 1.23 decides whether the chart can be read at all.
