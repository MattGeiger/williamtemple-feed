/**
 * The exhaustive contrast proof.
 *
 * A theme is two family choices plus a fixed stop map, so the configurable space
 * is finite: (17 chromatic + 9 neutral) accents × 9 neutrals = 234. This walks
 * all of it, grayscale identities included. Every theme
 * an operator can produce is therefore verified before anyone produces it —
 * a stronger guarantee than validating each configuration at save time.
