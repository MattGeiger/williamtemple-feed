 * The Phase 0 gate: can the pipeline reproduce the theme FEED already ships?

 * If it cannot recreate William Temple House from brand inputs, it is not ready
 * for anyone else's identity. This is deliberately a *perceptual* comparison
 * rather than an exact one — snapping trades precision for a provable space, so
 * demanding equality would assert the opposite of the design. What it holds is
 * that every token stays perceptually close and, more importantly, that nothing
 * crosses a contrast floor the current theme clears.
 *
 * This same comparison is re-run across the v1.7.5 OKLCH boundary; identical
 * brand inputs must produce identical output before and after (plan, Phase 5).
