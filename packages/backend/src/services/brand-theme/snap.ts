/**
 * Snapping a brand colour onto the Tailwind v4 palette.
 *
 * FEED does not reproduce an agency's colour exactly and derive from it. It
 * snaps to the nearest palette entry, because brand alignment is reconstructing
 * a colour *story* rather than matching a hex value, and because a finite
 * palette makes the whole configurable space provable rather than merely
 * validated (see `validate.ts`). Measured against four real brand colours, hue
 * lands within three degrees. Rationale and measurements:
 * docs/roadmap/v1.7-white-label-plan.md.
 *
 * Two constraints the measurements exposed:
 *
 *  1. **Snapping is role-aware, and neutral snapping weights chroma.** Tailwind
 *     4.3 ships nine neutral families, four of them lightly tinted. St. Johns
 *     Food Share's dead-neutral charcoal (chroma 0.000) lands on `olive-800` —
 *     a warm green cast across every surface — and splitting the pools is *not*
 *     enough to prevent it, because `olive-800` is genuinely the nearest neutral
 *     by unweighted distance. Amplifying the chromatic axes is what fixes it:
 *     at the shipped weight a source with no tint resolves to a family with no
 *     tint, while FEED's genuinely blue surfaces still resolve to `slate`.
 *
 *  2. **The family is chosen once, the stop per token.** Snapping each token
 *     independently scatters a theme across families — card in `slate`, muted in
 *     `mauve`, popover in `zinc` — which destroys the internal coherence of the
 *     ramp that is the entire reason to use Tailwind. `chooseFamily` picks one
 *     family for a whole role by best aggregate fit.

 * `zinc-800` (0.006); 3 reaches `neutral-800` (0.000), and FEED still resolves
 * to `slate` at every value tried. 3 is the first weight where "no tint in"

 * kind. A brand's colour story is a different question. It is the ranked list
 * of an organisation's actual colours, and those routinely include neutrals —
 * St. Johns Food Share's own three are a green, a near-black and an off-white.
 * Snapping that list through the chromatic pool silently replaced every
 * neutral someone chose with a saturated colour, so the wizard could not
 * represent the brand it was being pointed at.
 *
 * Chroma stays weighted here. Across a mixed pool that is what keeps a grey on
 * a grey rather than matching it to a vivid colour of similar lightness, and it
 * keeps a saturated colour off the neutral ramps. An exact palette entry
 * matches itself at distance zero whatever the weighting, which is the common
 * case now that the picker only emits palette entries.
