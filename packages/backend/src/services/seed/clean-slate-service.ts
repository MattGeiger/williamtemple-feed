/**
 * Return the instance to a seeded starting state.
 *
 * **This is not a restore, and the difference is not cosmetic.** Restore
 * *recovers* data someone wants back; reset *discards* data on purpose. Same
 * machinery, opposite intent — `buildAndSwap` is shared so the dangerous parts
 * are proven once, but every message around it has to read differently.
 *
 * The pre-swap snapshot matters more here than it does for restore: a restore
 * has an artifact to go back to if it was the wrong call, and a reset has
 * nothing except that snapshot.
 */

/**
 * What gets cleared: exactly the tables a backup covers.
 *
 * Using the same contract keeps one definition of "organization operating
 * data". Everything outside it is deliberately preserved:
 *
 * - **encryption keys**, or the instance could not read its own secrets;
 * - **the audit log**, because it is a security record — a reset must not be a
 *   way to erase the history of privileged actions, and the reset itself is
 *   recorded in it;
 * - **the sign-in policy**, because sign-in mode is authority, and resetting
 *   inventory is not a decision to change who may sign in;
 * - **documents and generated files**, whose rows point at files on disk that
 *   this operation does not delete.
 *
 * The roster is the one deliberate choice, below.
 */
/**
 * Derived data that has to go with it.
 *
 * These are *excluded* from backups — telemetry and generated output, rebuilt
 * from operation rather than restored — but three of them hold foreign keys
 * pointing into tables a reset clears:
 *
 * - `UsageRecord` → `AIConfiguration` and `Translation`
 * - `ShoppingListInstance` → `ShoppingListTemplate`
 *
 * Leaving them is not an option: SQLite enforces foreign keys here (the pragma
 * reads 1), so the wipe fails outright. Keeping them would also be wrong on the
 * merits — they are measurements of, and output from, data that no longer
 * exists. `ApiUsageLog` and `Alert` carry no such key but are the same kind of
 * thing, and a clean slate that kept yesterday's alerts about deleted items
 * would not be clean.
 *
 * `Document` and `TranslatedDocument` are deliberately **not** here. They are
 * uploads, independent of inventory, and destroying someone's files is not part
 * of resetting a pantry's data.
 *
 * **Known consequence:** deleting `ShoppingListInstance` cascades to
 * `ShoppingListPDF`, whose rows point at generated files under the storage
 * path. Those files are not deleted and become orphans on disk. They are
 * harmless and bounded, but a storage-reconciliation pass is the right place to
 * collect them rather than doing file deletion inside a database swap.
