/**
 * Put SQLite in write-ahead logging mode.
 *
 * In the default rollback-journal mode a write transaction blocks *readers*,
 * not just other writers — so one staff member importing a file made the whole
 * app appear frozen to everyone else for the duration. WAL lets readers
 * proceed against the last committed snapshot while a write is in flight,
 * which is the difference between "an import is running" and "FEED is down".
 *
 * `busy_timeout` covers the case WAL does not: two writers still serialize, so
 * a save landing mid-import waits its turn instead of failing immediately with
 * SQLITE_BUSY. Five seconds is far longer than any write here now takes.
 *
 * Both are per-connection pragmas, so they are issued at startup. `journal_mode`
 * is persistent once set on the database file; `busy_timeout` is not, which is
 * why it is set explicitly rather than assumed.
