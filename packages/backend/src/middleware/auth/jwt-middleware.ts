 * read on every authenticated request, because the token lives seven days and a
 * revocation that took a week to bite would make the access policy advisory
 * rather than enforced. One indexed point lookup on a table holding a handful
 * of rows, which SQLite serves from page cache; WAL mode (1.5.0-beta.2) means
 * it does not queue behind a running import.
 *
 * The read is skipped entirely when there is no cookie — anonymous requests
 * reach the public routes and the login endpoints unchanged.
