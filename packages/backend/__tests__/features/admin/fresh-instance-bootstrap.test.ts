/**
 * Who becomes Administrator on an instance nobody has set up yet.
 *
 * `docs/auth/administrator-authorization.md` and the admin-page implementation
 * plan both carry the same table — empty `User` table, first verified user
 * becomes Administrator — and the code did not implement it. Every first
 * sign-in landed as Staff, which is invisible on any instance that already has
 * a roster and total on the one kind that does not: a new Pi during disaster
 * recovery, where the operator finds a Staff account and no route into Data
 * Management. Found by rehearsing that recovery in a container, not by
 * reasoning about it.
 *
 * The trigger implemented here is narrower than the design's, by choice: an
 * empty roster AND no encryption key. Granting authority to whoever arrives
 * first is the most dangerous act available in this codebase, and one signal
 * of "untouched" is one failure away from being wrong.
