/**
 * The table standard, enforced against the source rather than trusted to
 * review.
 *
 * Three defects reached production because each was a convention that nothing
 * checked: column widths computed by hand in seven files and forgotten in nine,
 * a sortable header copy-pasted 37 times with padding that put the label 16px
 * right of the data it labelled, and one table that right-aligned its cells
 * while leaving its header left-aligned.
 *
 * Every one of those is visible in the source. So they are checked here, where
 * a new table trips the wire on the first run rather than on someone's
 * screenshot. See docs/layout/table-standard.md.

 *
 * - `custom-data-table` is imported by nothing — dead code, delete rather than
 *   convert.
 * - `translate-dialog` renders a short selection list inside a dialog, not a
 *   data table with its own toolbar and pager.
 * - `donor-analytics` is a real data table and the strongest candidate for
 *   conversion. It also formats its own dates, which is why it appears in the
