/**
 * Bucket grain is a card's own decision, not the page's.
 *
 * How Service Was Delivered plots every recorded service day at every range,
 * while the page-wide grain is monthly on the YTD and All presets. Labelling
 * that card with the page grain fed a day key ("2026-06-02") to a month
 * formatter, which built "2026-06-02-01", threw `RangeError: Invalid time
 * value` inside Recharts' render, and unmounted the entire Service tab — a
 * blank page, not a wrong label. Both presets that produce a monthly page
 * grain were affected; the daily presets were fine, which is what made it look
 * intermittent.

/**
 * Recharts skips rendering entirely at zero size, and jsdom gives every
 * element zero size — so a chart test that does not force dimensions asserts
 * against an empty container and passes no matter what the formatters do.
 * (Verified: the first version of this file passed with the bug reintroduced.)
 * The observer reports a real box and the layout properties agree with it.
