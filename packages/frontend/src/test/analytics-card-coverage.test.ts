/**
 * Every card on the Analytics lenses must be exportable.
 *
 * Nothing enforced this, and eight cards shipped that a user could see but not
 * put in a report — Recurring Availability, Operational Pressure, and six on
 * Procurement. They were not broken; they were simply never wrapped, and the
 * only way to notice was to enter selection mode and count what wiggled.
 *
 * So this reads the lens components as source and checks two things: that every
 * `<CardTitle>` sits inside a `SelectableBlock`, and that every `cardId` names a
 * card the server can actually render. Source text rather than a render,
 * because a rendered test only covers the data conditions the fixture happens
 * to produce — and half these cards only appear under a particular channel
 * filter or when legacy data exists.
