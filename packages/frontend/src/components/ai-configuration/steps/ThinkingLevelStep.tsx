/**
 * How hard the model should think before answering.
 *
 * Three things were wrong here, and all three cost money on every request.
 * The slider offered all four levels to every model, including the ones with
 * no reasoning control at all — a level set on those was accepted by the form
 * and then silently discarded. It defaulted to `high`, the most expensive
 * setting, and did so in two places of its own beyond the Add dialog, so any
 * configuration with no stored level opened at `high` and persisted it on the
 * next save. And nothing warned that raising the level raises the cost of
 * every request from then on.
 *
 * The levels now come from the model's catalogue entry, and an unset level
 * stays unset: the backend resolves it to the cheapest value that model
 * accepts (D2), which is `low` for a model that cannot turn thinking off and
 * nothing at all for a model without the control. This step never writes a
 * level the administrator did not choose.
