 * ticks, and an age axis reading "18-29, 45-59, 75-89, 105+" invites the reader
 * to believe those are the bands. But forcing every tick at a narrow width
 * pushes neighbouring labels flush against each other ("Under 18" against
 * "18-29"), which is the same illegibility by another route.
 *
 * So the labels tilt when, and only when, they would otherwise collide: a
 * horizontal label needs its own width plus a little air, and below that the
 * axis angles them and takes the height it needs to do it. A wide card is
 * unaffected and keeps the more readable horizontal labels.
