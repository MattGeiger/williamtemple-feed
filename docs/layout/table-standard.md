# Table Standard

## Status

Adopted 2026-08-05, applied to all sixteen tables in one pass. Enforced by
`src/test/table-standard.test.tsx`.

Amended 2026-08-05 after the Admin history conversion: the "no hand-rolled
tables" claim was wrong, and two rules were too narrow to catch the table that
proved it. See "Hand-rolled tables" below.

## The rules

1. **Tables render through `EnhancedDataTable`.** Directly or via `DataList`.
2. **Width is declared once, as `size`.** The table resolves it for every
   viewport. Nothing else sets a width.
3. **Sorting uses `<SortableHeader column={column}>`.** Never an inline button.
4. **Alignment is declared once, as `meta.align`.** The table applies it to the
   header and the cells together. Never align a cell directly.
5. **Dates come from `@/lib/formatting/date`.** `formatDate`, `formatDateTime`,
   `formatDateRange`. Never a local options object.
6. **Every actions column is labelled `Actions`.** Even where the header would
   otherwise be blank.

There is **one** table component. If a table looks too simple to need it, that
is the argument that led to the second one.

That is the whole standard. Everything below is why.

## What went wrong

Three independent defects, each of which read as "the tables are just
inconsistent":

**Widths.** `EnhancedDataTable` sized columns from `meta.style`, and `size` —
TanStack's own field, accepted and typed — was inert. Seven tables ran a
ten-line pipeline by hand to convert one into the other; nine never did, and
got `table-layout: fixed`'s even split. The Data Management imports table had
eight columns at exactly 262px each, so a 72px action trigger sat in a 262px
column with ~190px of dead space beside it.

**Header alignment.** Every sortable header was written inline as
`<Button variant="ghost">` with no `size`, so it inherited `px-4`. Cell content
sits at the `td`'s `p-2`. The label therefore began **16px to the right of the
data it labelled**, in 37 places across 8 files.

**Half-aligned columns.** Food Items right-aligned its Actions cells and left
its header string alone. Data Management did the same in reverse. Alignment was
decided per half rather than per column.

## Why it drifted

Every mechanism was **opt-in convention**. Skipping the width pipeline failed
silently and looked plausible. The sortable header was copy-pasted rather than
imported, so there was no single place to fix. And two people had already
noticed the alignment problem independently and solved it two different ways —
Analytics patched its buttons with `-ml-3` (12px, cancelling 16px), and
operational-reports factored a private `sortableHeader()` helper. Neither
change could reach the other fifteen tables.

A convention that is cheaper to ignore than to follow will be ignored. The fix
was to move each rule out of the call sites and into the component, then assert
the absence of the old pattern.

## Notes on the rules

**`size` is relative, not pixels.** Flexible columns get a percentage of the
remaining width in proportion to their `size`. Selection (32px) and actions
(72px) are pinned from `FIXED_COLUMN_WIDTHS` regardless of what they declare.

**`meta.style` still exists** as a per-column escape hatch, but it opts that
column out of the responsive recalculation. Prefer `size`.

**Alignment defaults to left, including numbers.** Right-aligning numerics is a
common convention and a reasonable future change, but it is a design decision,
not a refactor — the reference table left-aligns its counts, and this pass
deliberately did not change how anything looks except where it was misaligned.

**A residual offset is normal.** An icon button's centre sits about 16px from a
text label's centre, and a badge about 11px, because their boxes differ. That
is shape, not misalignment. What matters is that *text* columns read 0.

## Dates

**`m/d/yyyy`** — month first, no leading zero on either part. July 11th 2026 is
`7/11/2026`. With a time: `7/11/2026 3:04 PM`. As a range:
`6/2/2026 – 7/31/2026`.

Five formats were in use across two libraries:

| Written as | Produced |
| --- | --- |
| `toLocaleDateString()` | `7/11/2026` — correct, by accident |
| `toLocaleDateString('en-US', { month: '2-digit', day: '2-digit' })` | `07/11/2026` |
| `toLocaleDateString(undefined, …)` | whatever the viewer's browser says |
| `toLocaleDateString('en-US', { month: 'short' })` | `Jul 11, 2026` |
| date-fns `format(d, 'MMM d, yyyy h:mm a')` | `Jul 11, 2026 3:04 PM` |

The bare call was the correct one, which is the trap: writing the options out
explicitly — the careful-looking thing — is what produced the padded variant.

**The locale is pinned to `en-US`.** `toLocaleDateString(undefined, …)` formats
in the viewer's locale, so on an en-GB browser the same delivery window renders
day-first. That is a misread, not a preference.

**Charts are out of scope.** Axis ticks keep `MMM d`, and prose keeps
`MMM d, yyyy`. An axis is a scale and a sentence is a sentence; only data read
as a record is standardised.

### How this one drifted

Differently from the others, and more instructively. Someone *did* try to
standardise it. `analytics/index.tsx` carried this comment above a local helper:

> Tables across FEED render dates as zero-padded MM/DD/YYYY (see the
> shopping-list and AI-configuration tables). Analytics tables follow that one
> standard.

They surveyed real tables, drew a conclusion, wrote it down, and applied it —
and were wrong, because AI Configuration used a bare `toLocaleDateString()` that
drops the zeros. The evidence was inconsistent, so a careful reading of it
produced a confident, incorrect rule that then looked authoritative to everyone
after them.

A comment asserting a standard is not a standard. The format now lives in one
importable function with its own tests, so the question has an answer that can
be executed rather than surveyed.

## Column reference

| Column | `size` | Renders as | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `select` | any | `32px` fixed | Pinned from `FIXED_COLUMN_WIDTHS` |
| `actions` | any | `72px` fixed | Header is always the word `Actions` |
| everything else | relative weight | percentage of the remainder | Ratios, not pixels |

`size` on `select` and `actions` is ignored — they are pinned. On every other
column it is a **weight**: a column with `size: 200` beside one with `size: 100`
takes twice the remaining width, whatever the viewport.

### Percentages, not `calc()`

The widths are emitted as plain percentages (`22.22%`). They deliberately
over-declare — they ignore the pixels the fixed columns consume, so the total
exceeds 100% and the browser scales them down proportionally.

The tidier arithmetic, `calc(22.22% - 16px)`, **does not work**: a
`table-layout: fixed` table does not resolve a percentage inside `calc()`, and
every column silently falls back to an equal split. This was introduced while
consolidating the two width helpers and caught only by measuring — the inline
styles still read `calc(17.17% - 12.36px)` while the table rendered eight equal
columns, which is a convincing disguise. The `calc()` form is still used on
mobile, where columns are hidden and the arithmetic has to account for them.

**If columns ever render equal-width, check the emitted style first.** Correct
declared widths that do not take effect is the failure mode this project has
hit twice.

## Hand-rolled tables

**This section previously said "there are none". That was false when it was
written** — asserted from the tables in front of me rather than checked against
the tree, which is precisely the mistake documented under "How this one
drifted". Four files were building tables out of the `<Table>` primitives at the
time.

The count is enforced now rather than claimed. `KNOWN_HAND_ROLLED` in
`src/test/table-standard.test.tsx` lists what remains; a table not on that list
fails the suite, and deleting an entry from it is the last step of converting
one.

Converted:

- **Admin roster** — five rows, no sorting or pagination, so a plain `<Table>`
  looked simpler. What it bought was a second table to maintain, and it drifted
  immediately: an unlabelled 48px actions header where every other table names
  the column and pins it to 72px.
- **Admin history** — had neither a `ColumnDef` nor an action menu, so it fell
  through every rule here and drifted furthest: its own pager, its own header
  markup, and `toLocaleString(undefined, { month: 'short' })` rendering
  `Aug 4, 2026, 5:53 PM` beside tables reading `8/4/2026 5:53 PM`. Both rules
  were widened once it was found.

Outstanding:

| File | Why it is still listed |
| --- | --- |
| `analytics/donor-analytics.tsx` | A real data table and the strongest conversion candidate. Also formats its own dates. |
| `category-management/data-table/data-table.tsx` | Partial adopter — already shares `TableFeatureBar` and `useTableFeatures`, but renders its own rows. |
| `document-translator/dialogs/translate-dialog.tsx` | A short selection list inside a dialog, not a data table. Arguably fine as-is. |
| `document-translator/custom-data-table.tsx` | Imported by nothing. Delete rather than convert. |

`EnhancedDataTable` scales down for small sets: `enableFiltering={false}` and
`enableColumnVisibility={false}` remove the toolbar, and `emptyMessage` keeps
copy that fits the table ("No one is on the roster yet." rather than "No results
found."). Reach for those before reaching for a `<Table>`.

## Enforcement

`src/test/table-standard.test.tsx` scans every component file and fails on:

- any file calling `calculateColumnWidths` (computing widths by hand);
- any file containing `toggleSorting` (an inline sortable header);
- any column definition whose `cell` carries `justify-end` or `text-right`;
- any file that **defines columns or renders table markup** and formats a date
  itself — `toLocaleDateString`, a date-form `toLocaleString`, or a date-fns
  pattern with a numeric `MM/dd`. Month-name patterns pass, because the
  Analytics and operational-reports files hold tables and charts side by side
  and the charts legitimately use them. `Number.toLocaleString()` also passes:
  it is the thousands separator, and only the date form takes `month`/`day`/
  `year`/`hour` options;
- any file rendering `<TableHeader>` that is not on `KNOWN_HAND_ROLLED`.

The last two were widened after the Admin history conversion. The date rule
previously only inspected files containing `ColumnDef<`, and the hand-rolled
rule only fired when a `TableActionMenu` was also present — so a table with
neither was invisible to both.

`EnhancedDataTable` and `SortableHeader` are exempt: they implement the rules
rather than follow them.

It strips comments before scanning, because the first version of it failed on
a comment explaining why a file no longer used `justify-end`.

## Measured result

Header-to-cell drift on text columns, before and after:

| Table | Before | After |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Translation Management | +16px × 5 | 0 |
| Food Items | +16px × 4 | 0 |
| Category Management | +16px × 2 | 0 |
| AI Configuration, Document Translator, Shopping Lists | +16px | 0 |
| Data Management | 0 (no sortable columns) | 0 |

Reports, which never had widths, went from three columns at 398px each to
34.15% / 43.9% / 21.95% — with no change to its own column file. Food Items'
Actions offset went from −34px to −16px, matching every other table.
