# AI Model Catalogue Refresh — Discovery and Plan

**Status**: Implemented through the catalogue itself; the contents refresh is
what remains. Ten commits on 2026-09-11 — honest provider errors and
administrator alerts, Node 24, the three SDK upgrades, the server-authoritative
catalogue, providers and dialogs both reading it, both `model-specs.ts` copies
deleted, and D2's thinking defaults. Outstanding: Phase 4, the catalogue's
*contents* (retire 15, add 11), and Phase 5, live validation. Sections below
are marked where the code has overtaken the plan; where a section still reads
in the future tense, it has not been built.
**Tracks**: ISSUES.md #84 · roadmap v1.9.5 ("LLM catalogue and pricing audit")
**Companion**: [`translation-efficiency-and-local-models.md`](translation-efficiency-and-local-models.md)
— prompt size, thinking-token cost, caching, and a local TranslateGemma option.
**Provider facts checked**: 2026-09-11, against each provider's own model,
pricing, and deprecation pages (sources at the end). Prices and dates move;
re-check them on the day the catalogue is edited and record that date in the
catalogue itself.

## What was reported

Google no longer lets new projects call Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite, FEED's default
Google model. An administrator configured Gemini 3.5 Flash-Lite through the
**Custom** model option with a valid API key, and translation still failed with
*"Invalid API key configuration. Please check your AI settings."*

Production context (from the administrator, 2026-09-11): production runs
OpenAI **`gpt-5-mini`** as a fallback. Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite requests began
failing when Google moved the account from post-pay to prepay (the #80
incident). `gpt-5-mini` gives similar translation quality but is slower and
more expensive, and OpenAI shuts it down on **2026-12-11**.

Also from the administrator: production has **nine enabled languages** of 59
supported — English, Chinese, Spanish, Arabic, Russian, Vietnamese, Persian,
Swahili, and Ukrainian. Confirmed from production's
`GET /api/languages/enabled` on 2026-09-11; the stored name is `Persian`.
Bosnian also appeared there, enabled for testing only, and has since been
switched off. The
production Raspberry Pi 5 has **4 GB** of RAM. Production's `gpt-5-mini`
configuration runs at Thinking Level `minimal`, so its slowness belongs to the
model, not to a setting.

## Decisions so far

| # | Decision | Date |
|---|---|---|
| D1 | Offer flagship models as presets, with a UI warning that they are expensive and may not translate better. | 2026-09-11 |
| D2 | Default thinking to off, or the lowest level a model allows. Warn when a level above Medium is selected, because it raises the cost of every request. | 2026-09-11 |
| D3 | Model-parameter constraints (e.g. no `temperature` / `top_p`) are enforced in both backend and UI, so a forbidden parameter can never reach a request. | 2026-09-11 |
| D4 | Validation uses tiny requests (one sentence, a few strings), not whole-feature workflows. The earlier ~$220 test plan is withdrawn (see "Why the first estimate was wrong"). | 2026-09-11 |
| D5 | No commits until the design decisions in this sweep are final. | 2026-09-11 |
| D6 | A local model is a **fallback** only, never the primary provider. Staff choose it per blocked request (D12). **Shelved — see D16.** | 2026-09-11 |
| D7 | The frontier cost warning covers four models: `gpt-6-astra`, `claude-fable-5-1`, `claude-opus-5`, `gpt-5.6-sol`. The rule that assigns `costTier: frontier`: output price of $20 per 1M tokens or more. | 2026-09-11 |
| D8 | Google's mid tier is `gemini-3.8-flash`. It cannot turn thinking off, so its D2 default is `low`. | 2026-09-11 |
| D9 | SDK plan approved: `@google/genai` → 2.22, `@anthropic-ai/sdk` → 0.125, `openai` → 6.49, one provider per commit; `openai` 7 only after Node 22+. | 2026-09-11 |
| D10 | Node 20 → 24 approved as its own release, never combined with AI changes. | 2026-09-11 |
| D11 | Chinese means Simplified — code `zh-CN`. | 2026-09-11 |
| D12 | A blocking provider error offers **Use local AI model**. Choosing it opens a confirmation that the local model will take much longer; the request runs locally only after that. | 2026-09-11 |
| D13 | The local path supports everything a cloud model does in FEED: single and batch translation, DOCX auto-format classification, administrator-edited prompts, style-boundary instructions, and every builder translation mode. | 2026-09-11 |
| D14 | Local models are prototyped and validated on the development Mac (M5 Max, 128 GB). | 2026-09-11 |
| D15 | Raise an administrator alert whenever a cloud provider reports `exhausted` (out of credit) or `misconfigured` (key or model rejected). Part of Phase 1, and independent of the local model. | 2026-09-11 |
| D16 | **The local model is shelved.** Hosting it well means buying and configuring hardware, which makes it a project of its own. D12–D14 are kept as its design, along with the hybrid approach (TranslateGemma for plain translation plus a general model for everything else) and `AIConfiguration.role` to mark a local configuration. | 2026-09-11 |
| D17 | The shelved local-model design must warn staff when a requested language is not offered locally, distinguishing languages TranslateGemma was evaluated on, languages only the general model handles, and languages neither supports. Details in the companion document. | 2026-09-11 |
| D18 | Every catalogue entry records per-language coverage (`evaluated` / `supported` / `unsupported`). The Languages page and AI Configuration warn when an enabled language is not offered by the active model — at the moment of enabling it or choosing the model, not when a translation fails. | 2026-09-11 |
| D19 | Claude Sonnet 4.5 and Opus 4.5 retire outright, with no hidden `legacy` entries. They were short-lived, and the Claude 5 models are expected to last. | 2026-09-11 |
| D20 | Large bulk retries and long-document classification join the Phase 5 feature pass. If either returns a 524, those routes become the first consumers of a background-job table. | 2026-09-11 |
| D21 | Catalogue maintenance is a standing rule in `AGENTS.md`: audit at every release boundary and at least monthly. | 2026-09-11 |
| D22 | Consolidate into one **server-authoritative catalogue** (option A). | 2026-09-11 |
| D23 | Release order agreed: (1) honest errors and administrator alerts; (2) Node 24; (3) catalogue, SDKs, and thinking defaults, before 2026-12-11. | 2026-09-11 |
| D24 | OpenAI list confirmed. Older GPT-5.x models with no deprecation date (e.g. 5.4) are not offered: they cost more than `gpt-5.6-luna` for no benefit to FEED's work. | 2026-09-11 |
| D25 | Anthropic list confirmed. Only the latest generation, plus Haiku 4.5. `claude-fable-5-1` is far more model than translation or classification needs, but it is offered with the frontier warning; administrators decide how to spend their budget. | 2026-09-11 |
| D26 | `gemini-3.1-pro-preview` is offered with a **Preview badge** and validated like every other preset. When Google releases it as stable, administrators can reach the stable id through Custom until the catalogue audit adds it. | 2026-09-11 |
| D27 | `gemini-3.6-flash` is offered alongside `gemini-3.8-flash`. Same price, but it can run at `minimal` thinking where 3.8 cannot go below `low`. Phase 0 still measures both on FEED-shaped requests, to say which suits translation better — **not yet done: the Google account's prepaid credits are depleted**, so no Gemini generation could be measured on 2026-09-11. | 2026-09-11 |
| D28 | Claude prefill is replaced by prompt-instructed JSON, not structured outputs. Measured 2026-09-11: both return clean JSON, but structured outputs charge the schema as input — 220 prompt tokens against 49 for the same translation. Per-model format enforcement stays a Phase 2 catalogue capability. | 2026-09-11 |
| D29 | **Entitlement is verified when a configuration is saved or activated, not when a job starts.** One real request at the moment an administrator chooses the model, where the fix is; the runtime keeps the free model lookup plus a remembered failure. Only non-transient classifications (`misconfigured`, `exhausted`) are remembered, cleared on save and by a short TTL, held in memory. | 2026-09-11 |
| D28 | Long-running translation work gets a **translation-specific job table**, not a generic one, sharing code rather than a schema. Build it when a feature needs it — nothing does today unless the Phase 5 feature pass returns a 524. | 2026-09-11 |

## Open decisions

1. **Release order — agreed 2026-09-11 (D23):**
   1. honest errors and administrator alerts (D15);
   2. Node 24 (D10);
   3. catalogue, SDKs, and thinking defaults, before 2026-12-11.

   The local model is shelved (D16).

Resolved 2026-09-11:
- Claude Sonnet 4.5 and Opus 4.5 retire outright (D19).
- Long-running translation work gets a translation-specific job table, built
  when something needs it (D28).
- Production's language row is `Persian`, so no enabled language is refused
  today. The hand-kept provider language lists still move into the
  catalogue.
- The local-model questions are settled or recorded with its shelved design
  (D16). It is offered only when a staff request fails, never for automatic
  translations, and a local configuration is marked with
  `AIConfiguration.role`.

## Two findings, not one

1. **The catalogue is out of date.** Of the 16 selectable presets, one has
   already been shut down, five have announced shutdown dates between
   2026-10-23 and 2026-12-11, and three more are refused to new Google
   projects. None of the current flagship families from any provider are
   listed.
2. **FEED reports a model the provider refuses as a bad API key.** The routes
   that start translation check the key first, and that check turns every
   provider failure into `false`. So a key that works, calling a model the
   account cannot use, is reported as an invalid key. That wrong message is
   why this looked like a key problem rather than a model problem. The real
   provider error is written only to the backend log.

   *Fixed 2026-09-11 (`71bdee9`).* `ensureProviderAccess` classifies the
   provider's answer and names the model in the message staff read, and the
   check is now a free model lookup rather than a paid generation call.

## Why the Custom model still failed

The repository cannot say which of these it was — the provider's actual
answer is only in the backend log, on the line beginning
`Google AI API key validation failed:`. In order of likelihood:

*Two of the four are no longer possible.* The key check is a free `models.get`
lookup rather than a one-token generation call (`71bdee9`), and the Add dialog
trims a custom model id as Edit always did (`b3e8344`). Whichever cause it was,
the same failure today names the model and says what was refused.

- **The key check is a real model call, and it may be rejected.**
  `GoogleTranslationService.validateApiKey` sends `generateContent` with
  `maxOutputTokens: 1` to the configured model. On Gemini 3.x the output limit
  covers thinking tokens as well as text, so a one-token cap can come back
  empty or be refused; anything but success reads as a bad key.
- **The Google project is not yet enabled for the API, or has no prepaid
  balance.** Both become "invalid key".
- **Whitespace in the custom model id.** `AddAIModelDialog.tsx:90-91` saves
  `customModel` untrimmed; `EditAIModelDialog.tsx:94-95` trims. A trailing
  space in `gemini-3.5-flash-lite ` is a 404.
- **An older configuration is still the one in use.** `AIServiceFactory`
  uses the active configuration with the most recent `updatedAt`.

## Catalogue status by provider (checked 2026-09-11)

"FEED preset" means selectable in `model-specs.ts` today. Entries that are
commented out in `model-specs.ts` are listed for completeness; staff cannot
select them.

### Google (Gemini API)

| FEED preset | Provider status | Replace with |
|---|---|---|
| `gemini-2.5-flash-lite` (**FEED default**) | GA and priced, but answers **404 "no longer available to new users"** for new projects (developer-forum reports from July–August 2026, and this report). No shutdown date on the deprecations page. | `gemini-3.5-flash-lite` |
| `gemini-2.5-flash` | Same refusal to new users reported | `gemini-3.8-flash` (D8) |
| `gemini-2.5-pro` | Same refusal to new users reported | `gemini-3.1-pro-preview` (no GA Pro exists) |
| `gemini-3-flash-preview` | Preview; deprecated, replacement named, no shutdown date | `gemini-3.8-flash` (Google names `3.6-flash`; FEED chose 3.8, D8) |
| `gemini-3-pro-preview` | **Shut down 2026-03-09** — requests fail | `gemini-3.1-pro-preview` |

Current text models (paid-tier list price per 1M tokens):

| Model id | Stage | Input / output | Thinking levels (default) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `gemini-3.5-flash-lite` | Stable | $0.30 / $2.50 | minimal–high (**minimal**) |
| `gemini-3.1-flash-lite` | Stable, **shutdown 2027-05-07** | $0.25 / $1.50 | — skip: already scheduled |
| `gemini-3.6-flash` | Stable | $0.75 / $3.75 † | minimal–high (medium) |
| `gemini-3.7-flash` | Stable | $0.75 / $3.75 † | low–high (medium), cannot be disabled |
| `gemini-3.8-flash` | Stable, newest | $0.75 / $3.75 † | low–high (medium), cannot be disabled |
| `gemini-3.5-flash` | Stable | $1.50 / $9.00 | minimal–high (medium) |
| `gemini-3.1-pro-preview` | Preview | $2.00 / $12.00 (≤200k prompt) | low–high (high), cannot be disabled |

† Google states these prices **double on 2027-01-01**. The Flash-Lite
replacement costs 3× the input and 6.25× the output of 2.5 Flash-Lite; spend
limits sized for 2.5 will trip sooner.

Google also now says `temperature`, `topP`, and `topK` are no longer
recommended on any Gemini 3.x model. FEED sends them.

### OpenAI

| FEED preset | Provider status | Replace with |
|---|---|---|
| `gpt-5-nano-2025-08-07` | Deprecated 2026-06-11, **shutdown 2026-12-11** | `gpt-5.6-luna` |
| `gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07` (**production**) | Deprecated 2026-06-11, **shutdown 2026-12-11** | `gpt-5.6-terra` by tier; `gpt-5.6-luna` by price ($0.20 / $1.20 vs $0.25 / $2.00) |
| `gpt-5-2025-08-07` | Deprecated 2026-06-11, **shutdown 2026-12-11** | `gpt-5.6-sol` |
| `gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14` | Deprecated 2026-04-22, **shutdown 2026-10-23** | `gpt-5.6-luna` |
| `gpt-4o-2024-05-13` | Deprecated 2026-04-22, **shutdown 2026-10-23** | `gpt-5.6-sol` |
| `gpt-4.1-2025-04-14`, `gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14`, `gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18` | No shutdown announced; no longer in OpenAI's current model list | Retire from presets |
| *(commented out)* `o3-mini`, `o4-mini` | Shutdown 2026-10-23 | — |
| *(commented out)* `o3` | Shutdown 2026-12-11 | — |

Current models (per 1M tokens; 1.05M context, 128K output; Chat Completions
and Responses both supported):

| Model id | Positioning | Input / output |
|---|---|---|
| `gpt-5.6-luna` | Cost-sensitive | $0.20 / $1.20 |
| `gpt-5.6-terra` | Balanced | $2.00 / $12.00 |
| `gpt-5.6-sol` | Complex work | $4.00 / $20.00 |
| `gpt-6-astra` | Frontier flagship (announced 2026-09-03) | $10.00 / $50.00 |

GPT-5.6 reasoning effort accepts `none`, `low`, `medium` (default), `high`,
`xhigh`, `max`. **`minimal` is not among them**, and it is FEED's default for
`gpt-5-nano`. Confirmed against the API on 2026-09-11:
`400 Unsupported value: 'reasoning_effort' does not support 'minimal' with
this model. Supported values are: 'none', 'low', 'medium', 'high', and
'xhigh'.` So swapping `gpt-5-nano` for `gpt-5.6-luna` in the catalogue
**must** change the effort default in the same edit, or every request 400s.

Measured at the same time, and the reason D2 is worth having: on
`gpt-5.6-luna`, effort `none` answered a one-sentence translation in 19
completion tokens with 0 reasoning tokens, against 97 completion / 72
reasoning at `high` — roughly five times the billable output for the same
sentence.

`max_tokens` is also refused outright (`Unsupported parameter: 'max_tokens'
is not supported with this model. Use 'max_completion_tokens' instead`),
which is what makes the Custom path unusable for these models until it
carries a capability profile: a Custom entry gets no spec and falls back to
`max_tokens`. OpenAI's pricing page names the flagship `gpt-5.6-astra`, while
its models page, announcement, and Bedrock card say `gpt-6-astra`. Confirm the
id and its effort values with `models.list` and one probe before adding it.

### Anthropic

| FEED preset | Provider status | Replace with |
|---|---|---|
| `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` | Active; retirement **not sooner than 2026-10-15** | Keep; still the only Haiku |
| `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929` | Active (legacy); retirement **not sooner than 2026-09-29** | `claude-sonnet-5` |
| `claude-opus-4-5-20251101` | Active (legacy); retirement not sooner than 2026-11-24 | `claude-opus-5` |
| *(commented out)* `claude-3-5-haiku-20241022`, `claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219` | Retired 2026-02-19 | — |
| *(commented out)* `claude-sonnet-4-20250514`, `claude-opus-4-20250514` | Retired 2026-06-15 | — |

Current models (per 1M tokens):

| Model id | Input / output | Context / max output | Thinking |
|---|---|---|---|
| `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` | $1 / $5 | 200K / 64K | Extended (off by default) |
| `claude-sonnet-5` | $2 / $10 | 1M / 128K | Adaptive, **on by default** |
| `claude-opus-5` | $5 / $25 | 1M / 128K | Adaptive, on by default |
| `claude-fable-5-1` | $10 / $50 | 1M / 128K | Adaptive, always on |

Breaking changes that apply to FEED on Claude Opus 4.7 and later (all Claude 5
models):

- `temperature`, `top_p`, `top_k` set to a non-default value return **400**.
- Adaptive thinking is on by default. `max_tokens` covers thinking plus text,
  and thinking tokens are billed as output. `effort` (default `high`) sets
  the depth; `thinking: {type: "disabled"}` turns it off where the model
  allows.
- **Assistant-message prefill returns 400** (from Sonnet 4.6 on).
- A new tokenizer counts roughly 30% more tokens for the same text.
- Refusals arrive as HTTP 200 with `stop_reason: "refusal"`.

## The catalogue after the refresh

Twelve presets: eleven new, plus Claude Haiku 4.5 retained. Prices are per 1M
tokens (input / output), as checked 2026-09-11. "Default thinking" is the
lowest level each model allows, per D2; entries marked *verify* are confirmed
in Phase 0.

### Google — offered (4), retired (5)

| Offered | Role | Price | Default thinking |
|---|---|---|---|
| `gemini-3.5-flash-lite` | **Default** | $0.30 / $2.50 | `minimal` (measured) |
| `gemini-3.6-flash` | Mid tier, least thinking (D27) | $0.75 / $3.75, doubling 2027-01-01 | `minimal` (measured) |
| `gemini-3.8-flash` | Mid tier, newest (D8) | $0.75 / $3.75, doubling 2027-01-01 | `low` — floor measured |
| `gemini-3.1-pro-preview` | Top tier, **Preview badge** (D26) | $2.00 / $12.00 | `low` — floor measured |

**Measured 2026-09-12**, on a temporary key, closing D27's "not yet done":

| Probe | Result |
|---|---|
| `gemini-3.5-flash-lite` @ `minimal` | OK — **0 thinking tokens** |
| `gemini-3.6-flash` @ `minimal` | OK — **0 thinking tokens** |
| `gemini-3.8-flash` @ `minimal` | **400** "Thinking level MINIMAL is not supported for this model" |
| `gemini-3.8-flash` @ `low` | OK — **11 thinking tokens** |
| `gemini-3.1-pro-preview` @ `minimal` | **400**, same message |
| `gemini-3.1-pro-preview` @ `low` | OK — **11 thinking tokens** |
| `gemini-3.5-flash-lite` @ `high` | OK — 13 thinking tokens |

This is stronger evidence for D27 than the documented ranges were. 3.6 and 3.8
are the same list price, and the difference is not merely that 3.6 *allows* a
lower setting: at `minimal` it spends **no** thinking tokens at all, while 3.8
cannot go below `low` and bills 11 thinking tokens as output on every request,
however trivial. For FEED's one-sentence translations that is the whole
reasoning budget, paid on every string, forever.

Free metadata (`models.list`) also reports `thinking: true`, `temperature: 1`,
`maxTemperature: 2`, `topP: 0.95`, `topK: 64` and input/output limits of
1,048,576 / 65,536 for all four — which is where the token limits came from,
and which independently corroborates `fixedTemperature: 1.0` for Gemini 3.x.
Note `thinking` is a boolean there: metadata says *whether* a model thinks,
never at which levels, so the levels above required real requests.

Retired: `gemini-2.5-flash-lite` (the old default), `gemini-2.5-flash`,
`gemini-2.5-pro`, `gemini-3-flash-preview`, `gemini-3-pro-preview`.

#### Google candidates considered (open decision 1)

Google's stable text models on 2026-09-11. Prices are per 1M tokens; thinking
ranges are from Google's thinking guide.

| Model | Google's label | Price | Thinking | Lifecycle | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `gemini-3.5-flash-lite` | Fastest, most cost-effective 3.5 | $0.30 / $2.50 | minimal–high, default minimal | Named successor to 3.1 Flash-Lite | **Offer (default)** |
| `gemini-3.8-flash` | Newest, most intelligent Flash | $0.75 / $3.75, doubling 2027-01-01 | low–high, cannot be disabled | Newest | **Offer** |
| `gemini-3.6-flash` | Previous generation | $0.75 / $3.75, doubling 2027-01-01 | minimal–high, can be disabled | Google's named successor to 3 Flash Preview | **Offer (D27)** |
| `gemini-3.7-flash` | Previous generation | $0.75 / $3.75, doubling 2027-01-01 | low–high, cannot be disabled | — | Skip: same price and thinking floor as 3.8, and older |
| `gemini-3.5-flash` | "Legacy" | $1.50 / $9.00 | minimal–high | Labelled legacy | Skip: the priciest Flash, and nearest retirement |
| `gemini-3.1-flash-lite` | "Frontier-class at a fraction of the cost" | $0.25 / $1.50 | not verified | **Shutdown 2027-05-07** | Skip: already scheduled to retire |
| `gemini-3.1-pro-preview` (not on the stable list) | Preview | $2.00 / $12.00 | low–high, cannot be disabled | Preview | **Offer with Preview badge (D26)** |

Reasoning:

- **Previous-generation models are where Google withdraws access first.** This
  sweep began because Google refused `gemini-2.5-*` to new projects while
  still documenting them as stable, with no shutdown date. Offering 3.6 or 3.7
  invites the same failure sooner than 3.8, and each extra preset adds seven
  live validation requests, fixtures, and a monthly audit line.
- **3.6 Flash is the one previous-generation model with a real advantage, and
  it is offered (D27).** It can run at `minimal` thinking, while 3.8 cannot go
  below `low` — and D2 wants the least thinking a model allows. At the same
  list price, that makes 3.6 the cheaper and faster of the two for
  high-volume translation, and 3.8 the stronger model where quality matters
  more. Phase 0 still sends the same FEED-shaped requests to 3.8 at `low` and
  3.6 at `minimal`, well under a cent, so the guidance in the model dialog
  rests on measurement rather than on the labels Google gives them. Being a
  previous-generation model, 3.6 is also the first Google preset the monthly
  audit should expect to lose.
- **"Most intelligent" is not "best translator."** Google pitches 3.8 at
  software engineering and agents. The staff review of the lean prompt is also
  where 3.8's translations get compared with 3.5 Flash-Lite's.
- **Preview models churn in months.** Google's own record:
  - `gemini-3-pro-preview`: launched 2025-11-18, shut down 2026-03-09.
  - `gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview`: 2026-03-03 to 2026-05-25.

  Offering `gemini-3.1-pro-preview` is a maintenance question rather than a
  cost question, unlike Fable 5.1 (D25). Options:
  1. **Stable-only presets.** Drop it until a 3.x Pro reaches stable.
     Administrators who want it can use Custom once Custom carries capability
     profiles.
  2. **Offer it with a Preview badge** and accept that it will need replacing
     within months.

  **Decided: option 2 (D26).** Offer it with a Preview badge, and validate it
  like every other preset.

  The churn risk is handled by the lifecycle machinery rather than by leaving
  the model out:
  - the badge sets expectations;
  - the monthly audit (D21) notices when Google releases it as stable or
    announces a shutdown;
  - a saved configuration on it shows its shutdown date and replacement when
    that time comes;
  - until the catalogue adds the stable id, administrators reach it through
    Custom with the preview entry's capability profile.

| Offered | Role | Price | Default thinking |
|---|---|---|---|
| `gpt-5.6-luna` | **Default** | $0.20 / $1.20 | `none` |
| `gpt-5.6-terra` | Balanced | $2.00 / $12.00 | `none` |
| `gpt-5.6-sol` | **Frontier warning** (D7) | $4.00 / $20.00 | `none` |
| `gpt-6-astra` | **Frontier warning** (D7) | $10.00 / $50.00 | *verify* — and verify the id (`gpt-6-astra` vs `gpt-5.6-astra`) |

Retired: `gpt-5-nano`, `gpt-5-mini` (**production's model**, shutdown
2026-12-11), `gpt-5`, `gpt-4.1-nano`, `gpt-4.1-mini`, `gpt-4.1`,
`gpt-4o-mini`, `gpt-4o-2024-05-13`.

### Anthropic — offered (4), retired (2)

| Offered | Role | Price | Default thinking |
|---|---|---|---|
| `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` | **Default** (retained) | $1.00 / $5.00 | off |
| `claude-sonnet-5` | Balanced | $2.00 / $10.00 | effort `low` (measured) |
| `claude-opus-5` | **Frontier warning** (D7) | $5.00 / $25.00 | effort `low` — *not probed* |
| `claude-fable-5-1` | **Frontier warning** (D7) | $10.00 / $50.00 | always on; effort `low` (measured) |

**Measured against the API, 2026-09-11.** Anthropic's lifecycle, limits and
effort come from its own pages plus three live probes:

- `claude-sonnet-5` with `output_config: { effort: 'max' }` answered normally,
  and so did `effort: 'low'`. So Claude 5 effort really is `low … max`, and
  D2's cheapest setting is reachable — `leastCost: 'low'`.
- `claude-fable-5-1` with `thinking: { type: 'disabled' }` returned **400**:
  *"thinking.type.disabled is not supported for this model. Use
  thinking.type.adaptive and output_config.effort."* That settles its
  *verify* marker: it is always-on, `canDisable: false`, and the error names
  the exact parameter pair FEED must send.
- **`claude-opus-5` was not probed.** The effort page implies thinking can be
  disabled below `xhigh`, but that is an implication, not a measurement, so
  its marker stands.

Context and output are 1M / 128K for all three, default effort `high`, from
Anthropic's models overview.

> **Prerequisite for the Anthropic third of Phase 4.**
> `AnthropicTranslationService` sends **no** thinking or effort parameter at
> all — its four `messages.create` calls carry only `model`, `max_tokens`,
> optional `temperature`/`top_p`, `system` and `messages`. That is correct
> today, because every catalogued Anthropic model is `kind: 'extended'` and
> FEED keeps extended thinking off by sending nothing. Claude 5 is **adaptive,
> on by default at effort `high`** — so cataloguing these three without
> teaching the provider to send `output_config: { effort }` would have
> `resolveReasoning` resolve `low` and the provider drop it, running every
> request at `high` and billing the thinking as output on models at $10–$50
> per million. D2 inverted, silently, on the most expensive presets. The SDK
> is ready (`@anthropic-ai/sdk` 0.125 exposes `output_config` and
> `ThinkingConfigAdaptive`); the work is FEED's.

Retired: `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929`, `claude-opus-4-5-20251101` (D19).

**Watch:** Haiku 4.5 is the only retained model with a retirement window
(not sooner than 2026-10-15), and no Claude 5 Haiku exists yet. The next
monthly audit (D21) should check whether a successor has appeared.

### Deleted from the source as well — done (`b17b1f2`, `8dde4f7`)

Seven commented-out entries, all retired or scheduled:
- OpenAI: `o3`, `o3-mini`, `o4-mini`
- Anthropic: `claude-3-5-haiku`, `claude-3-7-sonnet`, `claude-sonnet-4`,
  `claude-opus-4`

These lived inside the two `model-specs.ts` files and went when those files
did — a side effect of the consolidation rather than a deliberate sweep. The
catalogue never carried them, so nothing needs removing from it.

## Counts

**Retire: 15 of 16 selectable presets.** Only `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`
stays.

Also delete the seven commented-out entries — every one is retired or
scheduled. *(Done: they went with the two `model-specs.ts` files.)*

**Add: 11.** The catalogue goes from 16 presets to 12.

| Provider | New presets | Count |
|---|---|---|
| Google | `gemini-3.5-flash-lite` (default), `gemini-3.6-flash`, `gemini-3.8-flash`, `gemini-3.1-pro-preview` (Preview) | 4 |
| OpenAI | `gpt-5.6-luna` (default), `gpt-5.6-terra`, `gpt-5.6-sol` (frontier), `gpt-6-astra` (frontier) | 4 |
| Anthropic | `claude-sonnet-5`, `claude-opus-5` (frontier), `claude-fable-5-1` (frontier) | 3 |

The Anthropic default stays `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`.

## Defects the refresh must fix

Each one blocks new models from working correctly, so they belong to this
work, not a later cleanup.

**Status, 2026-09-11.** *Fixed:* 1 (`71bdee9`), 2 (`bf3990b`), 3 (`314c04a`),
4 and 9 (`b17b1f2`), and 7 — the pre-job key check is now a free model lookup
instead of a paid one-token generation (`71bdee9`).

*Half done:* 8. `modelFamily` and the `-4-5-` test are gone and per-model
values live in the catalogue, but `VALID_THINKING_LEVELS`
(`routes/ai-config.ts:169`) and `ApiKeyConfigData.thinkingLevel` are still the
same four-value set, so GPT-5.6's `none` / `xhigh` / `max` and Claude 5's
`effort` cannot be stored. **Phase 4 hits this the moment those models are
added** — widening both unions is a prerequisite for the contents refresh, not
a follow-up to it.

*Still open:* 5 (temperature and top_p also arrive from `SystemPrompt` through
`PromptBuilder`, so D3 enforcement has to sit where the request is built), 6 (a
Custom model is still unpriced, so its spend limits never trip), and 10 (no
lifecycle badge in the configuration list — nothing there reads the catalogue
yet, so a saved row pointing at a retired model still looks healthy).

1. **Every provider failure is reported as an invalid key.** `validateApiKey`
   returns a boolean and discards the error (`GoogleTranslationService.ts:170`,
   `AnthropicTranslationService.ts:132`, `OpenAITranslationService.ts:204`).
   `translations.ts:291/425/520` and `documents.ts:479/825` then say "Invalid
   API key configuration". Google and Anthropic check the key by calling the
   configured *model*, so a model refusal is indistinguishable from a bad key.
   The #80 classifier (`classifyTranslationProviderError`) is not used on this
   path.
2. **Gemini thinking level has never reached Google.** FEED sends
   `thinkingConfig: { thinking_level }`. The installed `@google/genai` 1.11.0
   copies only `includeThoughts` and `thinkingBudget` out of `thinkingConfig`,
   so the level is silently dropped. The JS field is `thinkingLevel`, added in
   SDK 1.30.0.
3. **Every Claude 5 translation will be refused — twice over.**
   - Sampling: the Anthropic service always sends `temperature` (default 0.7)
     and drops `top_p` only for ids containing `-4-5-`; dateless ids such as
     `claude-sonnet-5` send both.
   - Prefill: translation and batch translation send an assistant message
     beginning `{` (`AnthropicTranslationService.ts:258`, `:460`) and prepend
     `{` to the reply before parsing (`:285`). Prefill returns 400 on Sonnet
     4.6 and later. Structured outputs (`output_config.format`) replace it.
     Classification already uses tool use and is unaffected.
4. **A Custom model gets no model-specific parameter handling.** Temperature,
   top_p, `max_tokens` vs `max_completion_tokens`, reasoning effort, and
   thinking level are all decided by looking up the exact model id. A Custom
   GPT-5.6 model therefore sends `max_tokens`, `temperature: 0.7`, and `top_p`.
5. **Temperature and top_p come from two places.** `AIConfiguration` carries
   them, and so does every `SystemPrompt` row (the seeded "DOCX - Low Temp"
   prompt sets 0.3), read through `PromptBuilder`. D3's enforcement must
   therefore sit where the request is built, not in either form. The UI can
   only hide the controls it owns.
6. **A Custom model is unpriced unless the administrator types prices in.**
   `applyModelSpecs` returns early for Custom, and `shared/validation.ts` does
   not require costs. With no costs, recorded spend is zero and the daily and
   monthly cost limits never trip.
7. **The key check uses a one-token output limit, and on Google and Anthropic
   it is a paid call** made before every translation job. On thinking-by-default
   models the one-token cap is shared with reasoning. Behaviour unverified.
8. **Parameter unions are too narrow.** `reasoningEffort` / `thinkingLevel`
   allow `minimal | low | medium | high`; `modelFamily` allows
   `gpt-4 | gpt-5 | o-series | legacy | gemini-3`; the backend
   `VALID_THINKING_LEVELS` and the four-stop `ThinkingLevelStep` slider repeat
   that set. GPT-5.6 needs `none`/`xhigh`/`max`, and Claude 5 needs `effort`
   plus a thinking mode.
9. **The Anthropic SDK's non-streaming guard caps `max_tokens`.** 0.57 throws
   "Streaming is strongly recommended" once the expected duration passes ten
   minutes. That is why FEED clamps Claude 4.5 output to 20,480 tokens, and
   the clamp keys on `-4-5-`, so Claude 5 (128K output) is unclamped.
10. **Saved configurations are never migrated.** `AIConfiguration.model` is a
    free string. When a provider retires a model, the saved row fails with no
    hint in the AI Configuration list.

## Requests that can outrun Cloudflare

Production sits behind Cloudflare, which answers **524** when the origin sends
nothing for 125 seconds (current Cloudflare documentation; #67 observed
roughly 100). Three translation paths wait for every provider call before
responding:

- **Bulk retry in Translation Management** (`routes/translations.ts`) awaits
  `Promise.allSettled` over every selected translation.
- **DOCX classification** (`routes/documents.ts:821`) awaits the whole
  `classifySegmentsBatch`.
- **Builder translate-missing-strings** awaits a language's batches.

On today's models a large selection can already reach the ceiling. Slower
reasoning models make it likelier, which D2's low-thinking defaults partly
offset. DOCX *translation* is asynchronous, but its progress lives in an
in-memory map (`services/docx/translation.ts`), so a container restart loses it.

Not a blocker for this sweep. **Agreed (D20):** include a large bulk retry and a
long document's classification in the Phase 5 feature pass on a frontier model. If either
returns a 524, those routes become the first consumers of a background-job
table (companion document).

## Two sources of truth, plus stale copies

The primary catalogue existed twice, identical in data, with nothing enforcing
it. **Both copies are now deleted** — the backend's in `b17b1f2`, the
frontend's in `8dde4f7` — and a test fails if either reappears:

- ~~`packages/backend/src/services/ai/model-specs.ts`~~ — parameter handling
  and `buildOpenAIParameters`. Replaced by `catalogue.ts` and
  `capabilitiesFor`.
- ~~`packages/frontend/src/components/ai-configuration/model-specs.ts`~~ —
  dropdowns, prices, and the limits the dialog pre-fills. Replaced by
  `GET /api/ai-config/models` and `useModelCatalogue`.

`palette-drift.test.ts` already cites this duplication as "the cautionary
precedent". These secondary lists also name retired models:

| Location | Contents |
|---|---|
| `frontend/src/types/multi-service-usage.ts:160-206` (`SERVICE_SPECIFICATIONS`) | `claude-3-*`, `gemini-1.5-*`, `gemini-pro`, `gpt-3.5-turbo` — used by cost forecasting |
| ~~`GoogleTranslationService.ts:57-63` (`GOOGLE_MODEL_PRICING`)~~ | **Deleted `8dde4f7`.** It was declared and never read — dead since before this audit, and invisible because `noUnusedLocals` is off |
| `backend/src/config/limits.ts`, `backend/src/config/limits/index.ts` | Token limits keyed by `gpt-4o-mini`, `gpt-4`, `gpt-3.5-turbo` |
| `backend/src/config/translation.ts:34` | `DEFAULT_MODEL: 'gpt-4o-mini'` |
| `backend/src/services/token/calculation.ts:105/161/192`, `routes/ai-config.ts:724` | Worse than "every model is tokenized as `gpt-4o-mini`": the line is `config.model?.startsWith('gpt-') ? 'gpt-4o-mini' : 'gpt-4o-mini'` — a ternary whose branches are identical, so the test cannot branch. Anthropic's tokenizer counts ~30% more for the same text, so the error is neither small nor symmetric, and it feeds the spend limits |
| `backend/scripts/fix-ai-config-token-limits.ts` | One-off script with retired ids |
| `frontend/.../AddAIModelDialog.tsx:52` | Default model `gemini-2.5-flash-lite` — still, pending Phase 4: no Google entry is `active`, so deriving a default would move new configurations to Anthropic. `thinkingLevel: 'high'` fixed in `b3e8344` |
| `frontend/.../form/AIConfigurationForm.tsx:346` | Placeholder `gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18` |

### Consolidation options

**A. Server-authoritative catalogue — approved 2026-09-11 (D22), and built
(`9e98ea2`, `b17b1f2`, `8dde4f7`).** One backend module is the
catalogue. `GET /api/ai-config/models` serves it, and a frontend service plus
hook replaces the frontend copy. One divergence from this option as written:
the hook is plain `useState`/`useEffect`, not React Query. `lib/react-query.ts`
exists, but its query keys are dashboard-scoped and the established idiom for a
domain lookup is `hooks/language/useEnabledLanguages.ts`. Entries carry lifecycle metadata
(`status`, `shutdownDate`, `replacement`, `verifiedAt`), a `costTier`, and the
capabilities below. Secondary lists are deleted or derived from it.
*For:* one list in one runtime, so the price the dialog shows is the price the
limits enforce, and the UI's parameter gating (D3) reads the same capabilities
the backend enforces. The list can badge saved models as deprecated or
retired. Within existing patterns. LOTTO, which ports FEED's AI configuration,
can copy one module.
*Against:* the dialog gains a loading and error state, and frontend tests need
a catalogue fixture.

**B. Shared workspace package.** `packages/shared` is imported at build time by
both apps.
*For:* compile-time types, no network call.
*Against:* no shared package exists; the established answer to duplication is
a mirror plus a guard. It changes Vite aliases, both tsconfigs, and the Docker
build context — a deployment change to discuss first.

**C. Keep both files and add a drift-guard test** (as in
`palette-drift.test.ts`).
*For:* afternoon-sized and within pattern.
*Against:* two edits per change, proves agreement not currency, and leaves the
secondary lists alone.

**D. Administrator-editable catalogue in the database.**
*Against:* prices become data that backups carry and restores bring back
stale; a mistyped price silently disables a spend limit. Rejected.

## Catalogue entry shape (built)

Capabilities replace the `modelFamily` string and the `-4-5-` test, so a new
model is described rather than special-cased. Shipped in `9e98ea2` as
`CatalogueEntry`, with two fields beyond this proposal and one that carries no
data yet:

- **Added since.** `fixedTemperature`, for a model that accepts temperature at
  exactly one value (Gemini 3) — distinct from `sampling: 'unsupported'`, which
  means omit the parameter entirely. And `rateLimits`, carried across from
  `model-specs.ts` so new configurations keep pre-filling their usage limits;
  those are account-tier allowances rather than verified provider facts, and
  are marked as such so nobody treats them like `pricing`.
- **Typed but empty.** `languages`. All 16 entries omit it, so the D18 coverage
  warnings described below have nothing to read.

The shape as proposed:

- `id`, `displayName`, `provider`
- `pricing`: input and output per 1M tokens, `verifiedAt`
- `limits`: input tokens, output tokens, and the non-streaming output ceiling
  FEED will use
- `sampling`: `supported` | `temperature-or-top-p` | `unsupported`
- `maxTokensField`: `max_tokens` | `max_completion_tokens`
- `reasoning`: kind (`none` | `effort` | `thinking-level` | `adaptive` |
  `extended`), allowed values, the lowest value (FEED's default per D2),
  whether it can be turned off
- `prefill`: `allowed` | `rejected`
- `lifecycle`: `preview` | `active` | `legacy` | `deprecated` | `retired`,
  `shutdownDate`, `replacement`. `preview` drives the Preview badge (D26).
- `costTier`: `economy` | `standard` | `frontier` (drives the D1 warning;
  `frontier` means an output price of $20 per 1M tokens or more, D7)
- `languages`: the language names FEED may send, mapped to codes, each with a
  coverage state (`evaluated` | `supported` | `unsupported`). This replaces
  the hand-kept per-provider name lists that currently reject `Farsi`.
  - **Decided (D18):** the same field lets the Languages page and AI
    Configuration say when an enabled language is not offered by the active
    model. Staff learn it when enabling the language or choosing the model,
    not when a translation fails.
  - The shelved local model's warning (D17) reads the same field.

A Custom model picks a capability profile from an existing entry and must have
prices before it can be switched on. This is also the path from a preview to
its stable release (D26). An administrator enters the stable id with the
preview entry's profile and the stable price, until the audit adds the stable
model to the catalogue.

## UI behaviour (D1–D3)

- **Parameters step.** Temperature and Top-p render only when `sampling`
  allows them. With `temperature-or-top-p`, choosing one clears the other.
  Where a saved `SystemPrompt` carries a value the active model rejects, the
  backend omits it; it never errors mid-job.
- **Thinking step — built (`b3e8344`).** Lists only the model's allowed values
  (not a fixed four-stop slider). Defaults to off, or the lowest allowed value.
  Selecting a level above Medium shows a calm cost warning with no blocking.
  Implemented by storing *no* level rather than a cheap one, so the backend
  applies each model's own cheapest value and a later model change still gets
  the right default. A model with no reasoning control says so instead of
  offering a setting it would discard.
- **Model selection.** A `frontier` model shows the D1 warning when chosen,
  and in the configuration list. A `preview` model shows a **Preview** badge
  in both places. A `deprecated` or `retired` model shows its shutdown date and
  replacement, in the dialog and as a list badge.
- **Error copy.** A refused model says the model is unavailable to this
  account and names it; a rejected key says the key was rejected. Both follow
  ASK through the #80 classifier's codes.
- **Language coverage (D18).** Two places warn, and neither blocks:
  - **Languages page:** enabling a language the active model marks
    `unsupported` shows a calm warning naming the model; `supported` without
    evaluation shows a lighter note.
  - **AI Configuration:** choosing a model lists any enabled language it does
    not offer.

  Server-side, a translation job skips an `unsupported` language with its own
  message rather than a provider failure.

## Testing

### Why the first estimate was wrong

The withdrawn ~$220 figure came from a guessed workload, never measured. It
treated each model as if it had to run FEED's whole features (a DOCX document,
nine-language PDF export, 40-string batches in every enabled language) at
about 100K input and 400K output tokens per pass. It assumed reasoning output
would dominate, then multiplied by four for three thinking levels plus a
re-run. That tested FEED's own pipeline once per model, when the pipeline is
the same whatever the model. Only the model contract — request shape, response
shape, errors — varies by model, and a single sentence exercises it.

Measured: FEED's default system prompts are 111–165 tokens (o200k tokenizer).
A one-sentence translation request is about 200–250 input tokens and 15–20
output tokens.

### Coverage, by what the administrator asked for

| Area | How it is proven | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Every AI operation works on every new model | Live smoke, per model (below) | Pennies |
| 2. Accurate error messages | Recorded provider error bodies → classifier → exact copy; route tests with the real `errorHandler` (as in #80) | $0 |
| 3. Pricing, names, modal content | Catalogue invariants + frontend dialog tests read from the catalogue; prices checked by hand against provider pages and stamped `verifiedAt` (no provider publishes prices through an API) | $0 |
| 4. Parameter constraints | Request-contract tests for every catalogue entry × every operation; UI tests that the controls hide; one live probe per provider proving the provider really rejects the parameter | $0 (+ unbilled probe) |

Also needed:

| Area | How it is proven | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| 5. Usage and cost accounting | Recorded responses carry real usage fields — thinking tokens included (Gemini `thoughtsTokenCount`, OpenAI `reasoning_tokens`, Anthropic `output_tokens`); assert recorded cost = usage × catalogue price, and that a daily limit trips | $0 |
| 6. New response shapes | Recorded fixtures: Claude thinking blocks ahead of text, `stop_reason: "refusal"`, output truncated at the token cap → a clear error rather than a JSON parse failure | $0 |
| 7. Thinking defaults and warnings (D2) | Contract tests that the lowest level is what is sent when nothing is chosen; UI tests for the above-Medium and frontier warnings | $0 |
| 8. Saved configurations on retired models | List badge and error copy tests; a migration note for production's `gpt-5-mini` before 2026-12-11 | $0 |
| 9. Catalogue drift in future | Audit script comparing catalogue ids and limits with provider model-list APIs | Free calls |
| 10. One real feature pass | DOCX translation and a Shopping List Builder PDF, rendered and inspected (required by `AGENTS.md`) — once, on the new default model only | Cents |
| 11. Every enabled language passes every provider's gate | Contract test: production's nine language names × each provider's language check. It catches a name one list spells differently before staff do. | $0 |
| 12. Every enabled language actually translates | One three-string batch per enabled target (eight), on each provider's default model only. Arabic and Persian also checked right-to-left in the rendered PDF. | ≈ $0.02 |
| 13. Administrator alert (D15) | Recorded `exhausted` and `misconfigured` bodies each raise one alert through the existing alert service, alongside the staff-facing message. Other codes raise none. | $0 |
| 14. Language coverage warnings (D18) | Catalogue invariant: every entry states coverage for every language FEED supports. UI tests: the Languages page warns on an `unsupported` language for the active model, and AI Configuration lists enabled languages a chosen model does not offer. Contract test: an `unsupported` language never reaches a provider request. | $0 |
| 15. Lifecycle badges (D26) | UI tests: a `preview` entry shows the Preview badge in the model dialog and the configuration list; `deprecated` / `retired` show a shutdown date and replacement. Custom accepts a preview entry's capability profile for a stable id that is not yet in the catalogue. | $0 |
| — | *Local model offer and parity tests (D12, D13) are shelved with D16; their design is kept in the companion document.* | — |

### Live requests per new model: 7 (4 billable, 3 unbilled)

| # | Request | Billable |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `translateText` — one sentence to Spanish, default thinking | Yes |
| 2 | `translateTextBatch` — three short strings including a duplicate, to Arabic (RTL, de-duplication, order) | Yes |
| 3 | `classifySegmentsBatch` — three segments (the DOCX classification path; the single-segment `classifySegments` has no caller outside the legacy `services/openai.ts` wrapper, so it is covered by contract tests only) | Yes |
| 4 | `translateText` at the highest level the UI allows — proves that value is accepted | Yes |
| 5 | Availability check with a valid key (model lookup) | Expected unbilled |
| 6 | Invalid key → FEED's "key rejected" message | Expected unbilled |
| 7 | Model id the account cannot use → FEED's message names the model | Expected unbilled |

Once per provider rather than per model: a raw probe sending a forbidden
parameter (e.g. `temperature` to `claude-sonnet-5`) to confirm the 400.
Quota-exhausted and rate-limit errors cannot be triggered cheaply and come
from recorded fixtures. That rejected requests are unbilled is the expected
provider behaviour; confirm it on the first run.

The retained Haiku 4.5 also gets the full seven, because its request shape
changes (prefill removal). So the total is 12 models, 48 billable requests and
36 unbilled.

### Cost

Per billable request at no thinking: about 250 input and 60 output tokens.
Request 4 allows up to 2,000 output tokens of reasoning.

| Model | One full run (4 billable) |
|---|---|
| `gpt-6-astra`, `claude-fable-5-1` | ≈ $0.12 each |
| `claude-opus-5` | ≈ $0.06 |
| `gpt-5.6-sol` | ≈ $0.05 |
| `claude-sonnet-5`, `gpt-5.6-terra`, `gemini-3.1-pro-preview` | ≈ $0.03 each |
| `claude-haiku-4-5`, `gemini-3.6-flash`, `gemini-3.8-flash` | ≈ $0.01 each |
| `gemini-3.5-flash-lite`, `gpt-5.6-luna` | < $0.01 each |
| **All 12** | **≈ $0.52** |

Budget **$5** for the sweep, covering a run per SDK upgrade and re-runs after
fixes. Cap each test key at $5 with the provider (OpenAI project budget,
Anthropic workspace spend limit; Google Cloud budgets only alert, so use a
separate project with a small prepaid balance).

### Test layers that cost nothing

1. **Catalogue invariants.** Every entry has prices, `verifiedAt`, lifecycle,
   capabilities, and `costTier`; every `replacement` resolves to an active
   entry; each provider's default is `active` and not `frontier`.
2. **Request contracts.** A table-driven test over every entry × operation,
   with the SDK client mocked the way `OpenAITranslationService.thinking-level.test.ts`
   already mocks it. It asserts the exact payload: no sampling parameters
   where unsupported (including values arriving from a `SystemPrompt`), the
   right max-tokens field, thinking in the right field with an allowed value,
   no prefill where rejected, and output within the non-streaming ceiling.
   Adding a catalogue entry adds its coverage automatically.
3. **Response parsing from recorded fixtures.** The live smoke script's
   `--record` mode saves one sanitised response per model and operation.
   Replayed in CI, they cover thinking blocks, usage fields, refusals, and
   truncation without a network call.
4. **Error classification from recorded bodies.** Real 401 / 403 / 404 / 400 /
   429-quota / 429-rate / 5xx payloads per provider, through the classifier
   and the real error handler, asserting user copy and error code.
5. **UI tests.** Parameters and Thinking steps render from the catalogue;
   warnings appear at the right thresholds; Custom requires prices and a
   capability profile; retired models are badged.
6. **Live smoke script (opt-in, never CI).** Keys come from environment
   variables. It runs the seven requests for chosen models and prints pass/fail,
   latency, provider-reported usage, and the cost FEED would record. Frontier
   models are skipped unless `--include-frontier` is passed, and the run aborts
   past a spend ceiling.
7. **Catalogue audit (free).** OpenAI `models.list` (ids), Anthropic's Models
   API (ids, `max_input_tokens`, `max_tokens`, capabilities), and Gemini
   `models.list` (ids, token limits, thinking support) compared with the
   catalogue. Prices are the one field no API reports, which is why
   `verifiedAt` exists.

## SDK and runtime upgrades

| SDK | Installed | Latest | What FEED needs from it | Breaking changes in between that touch FEED |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `@google/genai` | 1.11.0 | 2.22.0 (1.x ends at 1.52.0) | `thinkingLevel` (from 1.30.0) — **required**; 1.11 strips it | 2.0.0 changed only the Interactions API (steps, SSE event names, `response_format`). FEED uses `models.generateContent`. Node ≥ 20 either way. |
| `@anthropic-ai/sdk` | 0.57.0 | 0.125.0 | Typed `thinking` modes, `output_config.effort`, structured outputs to replace prefill, current model constants and non-streaming limits | Beta Files/Skills renames (0.122.0) and beta structured-output field move (0.72.0) — FEED uses neither. |
| `openai` | 5.10.2 | 7.15.0 (6.x at 6.49.0) | Nothing strictly: Chat Completions passes unknown `reasoning_effort` values through, and FEED already casts `minimal` past the SDK's `low \| medium \| high` type | 6.0.0: Responses tool-output types only. 7.0.0: **requires Node 22.** |

**Runtime:** the Docker images ran `node:20-alpine`, which reached end-of-life
on 2026-04-30. Moved to `node:24-alpine` (D10), matching local development;
`AGENTS.md` records pdfmake working on 20 and 24, but not 23. That release also
unblocks `openai` 7, which requires Node 22 or later.

Approaches:

1. **Minimum.** `@google/genai` → 1.52.0 only; cast new values past the other
   two SDKs' types. Smallest diff, but prefill removal on Anthropic is then
   hand-rolled against an SDK that does not know structured outputs, and the
   stale non-streaming guard stays.
2. **Current majors that run on Node 20.** `@google/genai` → 2.22.0,
   `@anthropic-ai/sdk` → 0.125.0, `openai` → 6.49.0. Every feature the refresh
   needs, no runtime change mixed in.
3. **Everything latest.** Option 2 with `openai` → 7.15.0, which forces Node 22+
   in the same change.

**Approved 2026-09-11 (D9, D10): option 2, with the Node upgrade as its own
release, never together.** The Node move (to 24, matching development) is an
infrastructure change on the Pi. Verify it on its own with pdfmake, Chromium
PDF export, Prisma, and the full suites, per the rule that one deploy should
not carry two candidate causes. `openai` 7 follows once Node is on 22+.

Order inside the sweep: one provider per commit — Anthropic, Google, then
OpenAI. Each commit runs its contract tests and that provider's live smoke
only (a few cents).

## Implementation phases

1. **Phase 0 — Reproduce. Done 2026-09-11** (354 input / 109 output tokens,
   under a cent). Run against real keys through FEED's own decryption,
   bypassing the factory so each provider could be probed directly.

   | Question | Answer |
   |---|---|
   | The reported failure | Reproduced verbatim: `404 This model models/gemini-2.5-flash-lite is no longer available to new users. Please update your code to use models/gemini-3.5-flash-lite`. A 404 classifies as `misconfigured`, so the new message names the model. |
   | `gpt-6-astra` or `gpt-5.6-astra`? | **`gpt-6-astra`.** `models.retrieve('gpt-5.6-astra')` is a 404 — the pricing page was wrong, the models page and announcement right. |
   | Do the GPT-5.6 models exist on this account? | Yes — `gpt-5.6-luna`, `-terra`, `-sol` and `gpt-6-astra` all retrieve. |
   | Which Claude models does the account expose? | All three 5-series (`claude-sonnet-5`, `claude-opus-5`, `claude-fable-5-1`), plus 4.8 / 4.7 / 4.6 and the 4.5 pair. |
   | Does Claude 5 reject the prefill? | Yes: `400 This model does not support assistant message prefill. The conversation must end with a user message.` |
   | Does Claude 5 reject `temperature`? | Yes, outright: ``400 `temperature` is deprecated for this model.`` The default value is refused too — the parameter's *presence* is what fails, so overriding the value cannot save it. |
   | Structured outputs vs prompt-instructed JSON | Both return clean JSON. Structured outputs charge the schema as input: **220 prompt tokens against 49** for the same translation. Prompt-instructed chosen. |
   | Tiny `max_tokens` with adaptive thinking | No thinking block; the text truncates at `stop_reason: max_tokens`. The old one-token access check would have returned junk rather than hanging. |

   **A limitation this exposed, and Phase 2 has to settle it.** Google's
   `models.get` **succeeds** for `gemini-2.5-flash-lite` on a key whose
   `generateContent` is refused. Phase 1 replaced a billed generation probe
   with a free metadata lookup: cheaper, but for Google it no longer catches
   the refusal it was built for, so a doomed job would start and fail
   mid-flight.

   **Settled by D29.** Not by making the runtime check heavier, but by moving
   the real check to where the fix is: verify entitlement once when a
   configuration is saved or activated, so an administrator choosing a
   withdrawn model learns immediately in AI Configuration rather than through
   a failed job. At runtime the free lookup stays, plus a remembered failure so
   the second doomed attempt is instant and correctly explained.

   This cannot be exhaustive — an account can lose entitlement between save
   and use, which is what the remembered failure and Phase 1's honest error
   messages are for.

   **Also observed:** the Google account's prepaid credits are depleted
   (`429 ... Your prepayment credits are depleted`) — the #80 condition, live.
   The Gemini `thinkingLevel` fix is therefore verified at the type and
   request-shape level only; it could not be exercised against the API.
2. **Phase 1 — Honest errors.** Key check returns the provider's error through
   the #80 classifier, and every translation and document route returns its
   error code. Availability becomes a free model lookup. `exhausted` and
   `misconfigured` raise an administrator alert (D15). Ships alone.
3. **Phase 2 — One catalogue** (option A) with the entry shape above, request
   building driven by capabilities, UI gating and warnings (D1–D3), and the $0
   test layers.

   **Slice 1 done 2026-09-11:** `services/ai/catalogue.ts` and
   `GET /api/ai-config/models`, carrying lifecycle and capabilities for the
   models offered today, with 17 tests. Nothing consumes it yet — deliberately,
   so the shape could be reviewed before anything depends on it. The endpoint
   is declared above `/:id`, which Express would otherwise match first.

   Remaining slices, each its own commit:
   1. Frontend service and hook; delete the duplicated `model-specs.ts` and
      collapse `ServiceStep`'s six repeated Select-plus-Custom blocks into two.
      Its dialog tests mock no services today and will need a fixture.
   2. Providers read capabilities instead of string tests, retiring the
      `-4-5-` heuristics and the narrow effort/thinking unions.
   3. Save-time entitlement verification and remembered failures (D29).
   4. UI gating and warnings: sampling controls, per-model thinking values,
      frontier and preview badges, language coverage (D1–D3, D18, D26).
4. **Phase 3 — SDK upgrades**, one provider per commit.
5. **Phase 4 — Catalogue contents**: retire 15, add 11, badge saved rows, delete
   the secondary lists.
6. **Phase 5 — Live validation** (seven requests × 12 models), one feature pass
   on the new default, docs, release. Production moves off `gpt-5-mini` before
   2026-12-11.
7. **Phase 6 — Local model: shelved** (D16). What reviving it needs is listed
   in the companion document.

The Node 24 release (D10) sits outside these phases and ships on its own.
