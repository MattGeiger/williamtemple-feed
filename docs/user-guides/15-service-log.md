# Service Log

Service Log records the operational details of each pantry service day. The
log is shared: everyone using FEED sees the same draft or finalized entry.

## Choose A Service Day

Open **Service → Service Log**. FEED starts on **Today** in the pantry's
configured timezone.

Use the left and right arrows to move between the weekdays enabled under
Operating Hours. For example, a Tuesday-through-Thursday schedule moves from
Thursday back to Wednesday, or forward to the following Tuesday when needed.

Select the date between the arrows to open the calendar. The calendar can
choose a different past date even when it falls outside the recurring schedule,
such as a special food-distribution event.

## Record The Day

1. Choose whether the pantry was **Open** or **Closed**.
2. Enter the available service, capacity, demand, and other operational fields.
3. Select **Save Draft** if the entry still needs review, or **Finalize Day**
   when it is complete.

A blank field means the value was not recorded. Entering `0` means staff
explicitly recorded that none occurred. Marking the pantry closed clears the
current values for that day while preserving the revision history.

## Choose A Visualization Range

The **Date Range** buttons prepare the page's Service visualizations. Choose
**7d**, **30d**, **90d**, **YTD**, **All**, or **Custom range**. The daily entry
controls continue to edit only the one Service Date selected below them.

## Configure Service Metrics

Administrators can manage **Service Metrics** beneath the daily Service Log.
These definitions determine which fields staff see when recording a day.

Select **Add Metric** to configure another field, or use a row's **Actions**
menu to edit an existing definition. Staff can use configured metrics but
cannot change the organization-wide definitions.

Choose the metric's **Position** as `1st`, `2nd`, `3rd`, and so on. Moving a
metric updates the shared Service Log order automatically; staff never need to
manage numerical sort values. Saved metric changes appear immediately on the
open Service Log without a page refresh, while unsaved daily-entry values remain
in place.
